'''Ago, ago Bhoiru, tuje vinnem'''

Hai, hai Bhoiru, without you,

Sukh(u) mhaka nã, sukh(u) mhaka nã.

I have no happiness, I have no happiness.



Satt(i) azranch' bens mhojea adin(u)

I own property worth sixty thousand rupees,

Tacho tivantto tuk' go di-in(u)

I can give you one third of the above,

Tachea velean(u) tuk' hanv sustentar korin(u).

To support you by its incombe.
