Mhaka soirik nhui rê zali,

I got engaged,

Nourean utrach´ mudi gaili.

The young man has given me a ring as a promise.

Main pain kazrachi mhojea toiari keli,

My parents have made preparations for the wedding,

Nourean mezun dot(i).

After the groom has received the dowry.



Hatak galun kaknnach´ chudd,

Having put the cluster of bangles on my hands,

Dakounk bonvtam soglo vaddo.

I go round the village showing them off.

Resperak hanv vetelim rosteaveleanu,

I will go to the nuptials on foot,

Tambddi sontri launu.

With a red umbrella.



Nouro sobit dista rupan,

The groom is very good looking,

Zoso surya dista kupan.

Just like the sun behind the clouds.

Dekun kalliz rabona ol´liant vo supant,

That's why my heart cannot be contained, (is restless)

Dorin dista gopant.

I feel like holding him in my arms.



Nourean lens c´ila sedacho,

The bridegroom has a silk handkerchief,

Doxim bangrachea bordacho.

With a border of gold.

Zauncho pormoll mogacho, jasmin fulancho,

With a sweet smell of love and jasmine flowers,

Adar fuddaracho.

He is the strength of my future.
