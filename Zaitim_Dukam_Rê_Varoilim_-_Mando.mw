''Zaitim dukam rê varoilim,''

I shed many tears,

Pixi zaucha' mum rê paulim.

And nearly went mad.

Zonylary boisun y aum rautalim,

I used to sit at the window,

Tuje saulle' rê tsoitalim.

Looking for your shadow.



Estrebilho (from another source)

Atam tuka choilea rê vinnem,

If I do not see you now,

Sukh na maka, kedinch tum sanddinaka.

There is no happiness in my life ! Never forsake me.



Burgeponnam' dekun mannka,

From my childhood, adored one (lit. gem),

Tuzo môgu mum rê maka.

I have loved you.

Inchan-tinchan tum bounaka,

You must not roam aimlessly:

Fidor ugtem asô tuka.

My front door is always open to you.


Koslo sintment tum dorynaka,

Have no sorrow;

Dusreach' aso nam rê maka.

I yearn for no one else.

Vido bettoitolim tuka,

I will dedicate my life to you,

Suka' pavoileari maka.

If you will give me happiness (lit. take me to happiness).


Dogaints' distin mum rê amtso,

The destiny of us both,

Eklechponnanum jieutso,

Is to live in singleness.

Guneanum nuim rê paitso-maintso,

This is not the fault of father or mother,

Ekloch rochlolea disatso.

But only of the day of our birth.


Atam tuka tsoileary rê vinnem,

Now unless I see you,

Suko nam maka.

I have no joy.

Kedinch tum sanddynaka.

Do not ever abandon me.




'''The Mando'''

''The mando is a dance song from Goa in Konkani. Although it is popular among all the social stratas of the Konkani-speaking peoples and many of the composers have remained anonymous, it should not be classified as a folk song. It is an art song composed for particular occasions. There have been many attempts to explain the origin of the word mando. One of them refers to the mand which was traditionally an open space of about 100 sq.m. where religious ceremonies were held and folk dances were performed. The text form of the mando is based on that of the traditional Konkani song ovi, which was usually sung at weddings''

''Most of the the traditional mandos, which gained the term “classical”, were composed in the 19th century. The polka and the valsavina (Vienna Waltz) with its three-four rhythm seem to have found their way to Goa. The mando was originally composed and danced by the Brahmin aristocracy of Goa, mainly of Salcete, whose spacious mansions had a big hall for festive occasions. A memorable moment in the history of the family was the 
bridal mando. The mando reflects the tranquil and leisurely character of this aristocracy. The Goan woman in the mando reflects the ideals and virtues then ascribed to her, namely self-sacrifice, piety and motherhood.'' 

''As a dance the mando is a square type (double file), men facing the women. When the partners come face to face in the centre, they retreat to the starting point, then move forward again crossing to the opposite side. The men then flick their handkerchiefs while the women open their fans. All in all, it is a stately and leisurely dance. The melody of the mando is slow in movement, with a soft and languishing atmosphere.''
