'''Vasco da Gama''' {{IPAc-en|,|v|ae|s|k|oh|_|d|@|_|'|g|ae|m|@}} (''Vasku'' {{IPA-kok|waːskuː|}}), often shortened to '''Vasco''', is a city in the state of [[Goa]] on the west coast of [[India]]. It is named after the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Vasco da Gama]]. It is also the headquarters of the [[Mormugao]] [[taluka]]. The town lies on the western tip of the Mormugao peninsula, at the mouth of the [[Zuari River]], about {{Convert|30|km}} from [[Panjim]], Goa's capital, and about {{Convert|5|km}} from [[Dabolim Airport]].

The city was founded in 1543 and remained in Portuguese hands until 1961, when Goa was annexed by India. The Indian Navy's Goa Naval Area (base) is located at Vasco from which it controls Dabolim Airport and, in effect, the entire tourism-dependent state of Goa. The historic 'Document of surrender' was signed by the Portuguese in front of Vasco's municipal council building.

==Transport and industry==
[[Image:Harbour - Breakwater P5300141.JPG|thumb|left|[[Breakwater_(structure)|Breakwater]] at Mormugao Harbour]]
Vasco is the only city in Goa which is well connected by road, rail, sea and air; by road by the [[National Highway 17A (India)|National Highway 17A]], by rail by the [[South Western Railway]], by the sea through the [[Mormugao]] Harbour and by air through [[Dabolim Airport]], thus serving as the main hub for most tourists visiting the state of Goa.

Vasco is heavily reliant on the port for most of its economic activity. [[Manganese]] ore mined in interior regions is brought to Mormugao by barges navigating the rivers [[Mandovi]] and [[Zuari]], and then either collected in the Mormugao Port to be loaded onto bulk carrier ships or directly loaded onto the ships using trans-shippers. Ore which is collected on the port is handled by state-of-the-art machinery called MOHP (Mechanical Ore-Handling Plant). This includes massive bucket wheel loaders and miles of conveyor belts. The port has berthing facilities for large cruise liners as well as a floating dry dock. There are shipping and freight forwarding agents as well as offices of major mining companies based in the city.

The Mormugao Port Trust which operates the port is the largest employer in the Vasco region and has a complete mini-township in Headland Sada which includes schools, residential complexes and amenities for employees of the Port.

==Tourism and culture==
[[Bogmalo Beach]] is {{convert|8|km}} from Vasco. This beach is quite risky as it has underwater currents. Hollant (Issorcim) and Baina are two smaller beaches around Vasco.

Apart from the nearby beaches, the city of Vasco is bereft of any major tourist attractions, the salient monument being the 400-year old St. Andrew's Church located at the entrance of the city. However the [[Naval Aviation Museum (India)|Naval Aviation Museum]] near the airport is a popular tourist spot and is the only such museum in India. It profiles the evolution and history of Indian naval aviation through aircraft exhibits and rare photographs.

One of Goa's premier musical groups, Diamond Orchestra, hails from Vasco. The town is also home to several English bands from Goa, notably Lynx and Kollectiv Soul. 

Vasco is known for the annual Shri Damodar Bhajani Saptah<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism-of-goa.com/fairs-festivals/vasco-saptah.html |title=Tourism-of-goa.com |publisher=Tourism-of-goa.com |date=2012-06-08 |accessdate=2012-08-06}} {{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref> fair held in [[Shravan]] month of Hindu lunar calendar preceding the festival of [[Nag panchami]].

Vasco da Gama hosted the relics of Saint [[John Bosco]], albeit temporarily, on 21 August 2011, at the St. Andrew's Church, while the relics were on their world tour.

Like all towns and cities in Goa, Vasco celebrates the [[Shigmo]]/ xigmo and [[Carnival]] annually with a street parade where floats from all over Goa participate.

==Sports==
Like the rest of Goa, [[Association football|football]] is the most popular sport in Vasco. Two teams from the town have participated in the [[I-League]] - [[Vasco Sports Club]] and [[Salgaocar Sports Club]]. Salgaocar SC were Champions of the 1998-99 season<ref>[http://www.indianfootball.com/team/salgaocar.html Indianfootball.com]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref> of the erstwhile [[National Football League (India)|NFL]]. [[Tilak Maidan]] is a 15,000 capacity football ground based in the city. The stadium sporting a magnificent turf  hosted I-league matches during April 2013, as the home ground for the four teams from Goa in the league, when Fatorda Stadium was closed down for renovation. http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/1064/i-league/2013/04/02/3871446/i-league-action-to-resume-at-tilak-maidan-from-thursday

Although cricket is not as popular as football, a Vasco resident [[Shadab Jakati]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.cricinfo.com/india/content/player/29655.html |title=Shadab Jakati - India Cricket - Cricket Players and Officials - ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=Content.cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref> plays for Goa in the [[Ranji Trophy]] first-class competition and has also been selected to play for the [[Chennai Super Kings]] [[Indian Premier League|IPL]] franchise.

==Politics==
The city of Vasco falls under the boundaries of the Mormugao (South Goa) constituency in the [[Lok Sabha]]. The current Member of Parliament is Francisco Sardinha of the [[Indian National Congress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://india.gov.in/govt/loksabhampdetail.php?mpcode=3914 |title=Shri Francisco Sardinha - Members of Parliament (Lok Sabha) - Who's Who - Government: National Portal of India |publisher=India.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref>

Vasco elects its representative to the Goa Legislative Assembly, the current MLA is Carlos Almeida of the BJP.

==Research==
The [[National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research]] (NCAOR)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaor.nic.in/ |title=National Centre for Antarctic & Ocean Research, Goa, India |publisher=NCAOR.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref> located at Headland Sada is a research and development institution administered by the Ministry of Earth Sciences. It is responsible for administering the Indian Antarctic Program and maintains the Indian government's Antarctic research station, Maitri. In addition to laboratories for marine sample processing/analyses, it hosts a special low-temperature ice core sample storage facility.
