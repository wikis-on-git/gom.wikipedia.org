''Zaito tempo zalo,''

A long time has passed now

Tujo môgo (môgu) riglear maka.

That I have fallen in love with you,

To sosunezo manka,

I cannot bear it any longer, my jewel,

Bedloi zorir banho gehein dis'sota.

I feel like having bath at the Bedloi spring.



Chusmo/ Refrain:

Ai, ai, sonsunezo,

Ah, ah, I cannot bear it any longer,

Manka ugddas eta tujo.

My jewel, your memory assails me.



Ontoscornanchea mojea moga,

My love of the depth of conscience,

Calzachea mojea suka,

My happiness of the heart,

Anjea sarkem tujem manka,

Your appearance is like an angel, my jewel,

Gravar mujea calzanto zalolem assa.

It is already engraved in my heart.



Chusmo/ Refrain:

Ai, ai, rhortam aum,

Ah, ah, I weep my heart for you,

Mogacho gutt sangonezo munum.

For I am unable to disclose love´s secret.



Tujem kalliz mojem munum,

That your heart has been won by me

Porgotlo soglo gãum,

It was proclaimed by the whole village,



Atam sandun gheleari maka tuum,

If you go away now deserting me,

Jiv mojo tuka ditolim ãum.

I will commit suicide for you.



Chusmo/ Refrain:

Ai, ai, mogacho abras,

Ah, ah, an embrace of love,

Manka diuncheaco rautam tuka.


My jewel, I await to bestow you.


'''The Mando'''

''The mando is a dance song from [[गोंय|Goa]] in Konkani. Although it is popular among all the social stratas of the Konkani-speaking peoples and many of the composers have remained anonymous, it should not be classified as a folk song. It is an art song composed for particular occasions. There have been many attempts to explain the origin of the word mando. One of them refers to the mand which was traditionally an open space of about 100 sq.m. where religious ceremonies were held and folk dances were performed. The text form of the mando is based on that of the traditional Konkani song ovi, which was usually sung at weddings''

''Most of the the traditional mandos, which gained the term “classical”, were composed in the 19th century. The polka and the valsavina (Vienna Waltz) with its three-four rhythm seem to have found their way to [[गोंय|Goa]]. The mando was originally composed and danced by the Brahmin aristocracy of [[गोंय|Goa]], mainly of Salcete, whose spacious mansions had a big hall for festive occasions. A memorable moment in the history of the family was the 
bridal mando. The mando reflects the tranquil and leisurely character of this aristocracy. The [[गोंय|Goa]]n woman in the mando reflects the ideals and virtues then ascribed to her, namely self-sacrifice, piety and motherhood.'' 

''As a dance the mando is a square type (double file), men facing the women. When the partners come face to face in the centre, they retreat to the starting point, then move forward again crossing to the opposite side. The men then flick their handkerchiefs while the women open their fans. All in all, it is a stately and leisurely dance. The melody of the mando is slow in movement, with a soft and languishing atmosphere.''
