Derant(u) champo,

In front of the house there stands a champo-tree,

Zonelar fulanchi dali.

On the window sill lies a flower basket.



Fulam molaitali,

She was bargaining for flowers,

Rê okol bai mhum rê amchi.

Our dear young bride.


Ful(u) gô rompeachem,

The flowers of the chilli-plant,

Bai tuka mautam funkeachem.

I shall give you free to wear, my Lady.



Ful(u) maula tallier,

If you wear the flower on the back of your head,

Bai tuca apoitai mallier.

My Lady, you will be called upstairs (to the loft).
