''Dôriéachea larari,''

Upon the waves of the sea,

Chondrimãnchea uzvaddari,

In the light of the moon,

Heam mojeã kensanchê pantiêru (pantieri)[31],

Upon this the pleath of my hair,

Jurar zatam tujeach rê (another version: tujeach rê = Deva) mucaru (mucari).

I give an oath in your presence.

Eu rê moga, choi rê maca,

Come my love, look at me,

Mogache dolle lai rê maca.

Look at me with your loving eyes.

An adorable Cherubim,

Ho ecuch amcho pacto,

This our union is unique,

Juramento zait rê sagrado. (Chusmo)

Our oath will be sacred. (Refrain)


Ratrich nidênt ãum sopnetam,

At night I dream during my sleep,

Utton abras diuncheac vettam,

Getting up I go to embrace you,

Zaguim zaun ãum fottoutam,

When I wake up I feel deceived,

He martir tucach té bettoitam. (Chusmo)

These my sufferings I offer to you. (Refrain)


'''The Mando'''

''The mando  is a dance song from Goa in Konkani. Although it is popular among all the social stratas of the Konkani-speaking peoples and many of the composers have remained anonymous, it should not be classified as a folk song. It is an art song composed for particular occasions. There have been many attempts to explain the origin of the word mando. One of them refers to the mand which was traditionally an open space of about 100 sq.m. where religious ceremonies were held and folk dances were performed.  The text form of the  mando is based on that of the traditional Konkani song ovi, which was usually sung at weddings''

''Most of the the traditional mandos, which gained the term “classical”, were composed in the 19th century. The polka and the valsavina (Vienna Waltz) with its three-four rhythm seem to have found their way to Goa. The mando was originally composed and danced by the Brahmin aristocracy of Goa, mainly of Salcete, whose spacious mansions had a big hall for festive occasions. A memorable moment in the history of the family was the 
bridal mando. The mando reflects the tranquil and leisurely character of this aristocracy. The Goan woman in the mando reflects the ideals and virtues then ascribed to her, namely self-sacrifice, piety and motherhood.'' 

''As a dance the mando is a square type (double file), men facing the women. When the partners come face to face in the centre, they retreat to the starting point, then move forward again crossing to the opposite side. The men then flick their handkerchiefs while the women open their fans. All in all, it is a stately and leisurely dance. The melody of the mando is slow in movement, with a soft and languishing atmosphere.''
