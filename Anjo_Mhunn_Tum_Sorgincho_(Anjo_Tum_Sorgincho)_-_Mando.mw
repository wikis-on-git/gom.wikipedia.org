Anjo mhunn tum sorgincho,

Uzvadd poddlo noketrancho.

The world was lit with the light of stars.

Amcho môgu ektthaim korcho,

May our love be joined together,

Kazrach' sakramento zoddcho.

May we blessed with the sacrament of marriage.



Chusmo/ Refrain:

Nozo, nozo-rê mojean,

I cannot live without you,

Tuje vinnem sonvsar tannum nozo.

I do not want to be in this world without you.



Muzo gutt sanglolo tuka,

I have confided to you my secret,

Responder kelem naim maka.

You did not send me any reply.

Tuje vinn konn naim-rê moga,

There is no one else for me, but you, my love,

Sonvs'rant feliz kortol' maka. (Chusmo)

To make me happy in this world. (Refrain)



Dolleanch maulli mhunnon moji,


Dimbier adorar keloli ...

I had adored it on my knees.

Gonnim porim uddon geli,

It flew off like an eagle,

Dukhan ghalun otmo-kuddi. (Chusmo)

Plunging my soul and body in deep sorrow. (Refrain)
