Amguelia ghor´ sokol,

Next to our house,

Rottái te kirkire

The parrots are screeching.

Kumar tum sanje io ghe,

[[God]]mother please come in the evening

Mhoichinchekodde.

to the plot near the tamarind tree.



Omdum ami bat mollum,

By harvesting paddy this year,

Bol´leai choi kitu kodde.

See how many bamboo silos have been filled.

Kumar tum sanje io ghe,

[[God]]mother, you come in the evening,

Mhoichinchekodde.

To the plot near the tamarind tree.



Tandlacho pais korunk,

To make a rice pudding,

All´eai choi buddkule.

Look we have brought mud vessels.

Kumar tum sanje io ghe,

[[God]]mother, please come in the evening

Mhoichinchekodde.

To the plot near the tamarind tree.
