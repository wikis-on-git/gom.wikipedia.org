Amguelia ghor´ sokol,

Next to our house,

Rottái te kirkire

The parrots are screeching.

Kumar tum sanje io ghe,

Godmother please come in the evening

Mhoichinchekodde.

to the plot near the tamarind tree.



Omdum ami bat mollum,

By harvesting paddy this year,

Bol´leai choi kitu kodde.

See how many bamboo silos have been filled.

Kumar tum sanje io ghe,

Godmother, you come in the evening,

Mhoichinchekodde.

To the plot near the tamarind tree.



Tandlacho pais korunk,

To make a rice pudding,

All´eai choi buddkule.

Look we have brought mud vessels.

Kumar tum sanje io ghe,

Godmother, please come in the evening

Mhoichinchekodde.

To the plot near the tamarind tree.
