Aji pasun Devacheryh patyeunum,

I have trusted only in God until today,

Sonxtalyhim mujem burgeponnom.

I was bearing my youth.

Sorgim surya noketram tsoinum,

Watching the sun and the stars in the sky,

Vellu muzo passar kortalylim y aum-um.

I would vile away my time.

Chusmo/ Refrain:

Vodorho morho ailearyh rê moga,

Even if a handsome young peacock should come by, my love,

Kedinch y aum sanndduchim nam rê tuka.

I will never, ever leave you.
