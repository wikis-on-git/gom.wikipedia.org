Aitrach'y aum-um missa' votalim,

I (female) used to go to Mass on Sundays,

Soglem misso convers martalim.

And talk during the whole Mass.

Manual vatsun lok' dakoitalim,

I made people believe I was reading the missal,

Anchan-tinchan pajnam portitalim.

And turned the pages this way and that.


Ai cacadam marnum misso y aikotam,

Hey! I hear Mass amid pearls of laughter,

Bairi sornum cumprimentar kortam.

And on leaving church greet everybody outside.


Sodanch y amim banha' votaliym,

We used to go bathing always,

Manencheri kenso galtalim.

I letting my hair stream over my neck.

Garantule sintmento ditalim,

I used to tell people of the things that went on at home,

Bagery vosun sopttunum porhtalim.

And on going home, used to throw myself on the bed.


Ai, kainchi moga bieunaka,

You must not worry about this, love,

Osoly' sintment zaite zatai maka.

I often get such moods.



Kallizacha muja rê gondda,

Oh Love/ The bud of my heart!

Kitem tum chintita,

What is in your thoughts now?

Gortso y amig consolaro korta,

My friend at home consoles me,

Kainchi tum bieunaka muntta.

And tells me not to let anything upset me.



Ai mogatso y abras ditolim tuka,

Oh, dear one, I will embrace you fondly,

Sangilolem keleary tunvem maka.

If you do to me what I tell you to.



Do si rê si la sol.

Do, si, re, la, sol,

Lisaum[4] geun vegim maka sorhy.

Let me off from the lesson quickly.

Convers marum' foxi asa maka tsorhy.

I am very eager to talk with you.



'''The Mando'''

''The mando is a dance song from Goa in Konkani. Although it is popular among all the social stratas of the Konkani-speaking peoples and many of the composers have remained anonymous, it should not be classified as a folk song. It is an art song composed for particular occasions. There have been many attempts to explain the origin of the word mando. One of them refers to the mand which was traditionally an open space of about 100 sq.m. where religious ceremonies were held and folk dances were performed. The text form of the mando is based on that of the traditional Konkani song ovi, which was usually sung at weddings''

''Most of the the traditional mandos, which gained the term “classical”, were composed in the 19th century. The polka and the valsavina (Vienna Waltz) with its three-four rhythm seem to have found their way to Goa. The mando was originally composed and danced by the Brahmin aristocracy of Goa, mainly of Salcete, whose spacious mansions had a big hall for festive occasions. A memorable moment in the history of the family was the 
bridal mando. The mando reflects the tranquil and leisurely character of this aristocracy. The Goan woman in the mando reflects the ideals and virtues then ascribed to her, namely self-sacrifice, piety and motherhood.'' 

''As a dance the mando is a square type (double file), men facing the women. When the partners come face to face in the centre, they retreat to the starting point, then move forward again crossing to the opposite side. The men then flick their handkerchiefs while the women open their fans. All in all, it is a stately and leisurely dance. The melody of the mando is slow in movement, with a soft and languishing atmosphere.''
