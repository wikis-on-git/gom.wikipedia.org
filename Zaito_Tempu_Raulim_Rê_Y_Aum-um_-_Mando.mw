''Zaito tempu raulim rê y aum-um,''

I (female) waited long,

Tuj' lagy'm cazar zatolim munnum.

In the hope of marrying you.

Devan maka nam rê nirmunko,

God did not ordain,

Mogach' potinny zauchak y aum-um.

That I should be your loving wife.



Retrat darhy rê parcel korunum,

Make a parcel of your picture and send it to me.

Urloly' dis karhytam sarkea' tuja tsounum.

I shall pass the rest of my days looking at your likeness.



Vollvolly' tuje tsounum mirhmirhe,

When I see your pain and torments,

Dukany'm muje bortai-i dolle.

My eyes fill with tears.

Cazar y aum-um zatam y axloly'm maim,

Mother, I would really have liked to marry,

Amig muja Costakorhe.

My friend Costa.


Adeus Costa ixtta re muja,

Good bye, Costa, my friend.

Agrhas keleary haucha'-jeucha'naka.

When I think of you I lose all my taste for food.



Cazar zauche adim rê moga,

Before you got married, darling,

Zaite sintment diloly' tunvy'm maka.

You gave me much pain.

Chittiry-chitteo darhylolei tuka,

I sent you one letter after another,

Echi vorsa' yo munn gara.

To come home this very year.



Adeus Costa ixtta rê muja,

Good bye, Costa, my friend.

Ugddas kortrich sonsar bongum dista.

When I think of it, I feel life is worthless.


'''The Mando'''

''The mando is a dance song from [[गोंय|Goa]] in Konkani. Although it is popular among all the social stratas of the Konkani-speaking peoples and many of the composers have remained anonymous, it should not be classified as a folk song. It is an art song composed for particular occasions. There have been many attempts to explain the origin of the word mando. One of them refers to the mand which was traditionally an open space of about 100 sq.m. where religious ceremonies were held and folk dances were performed. The text form of the mando is based on that of the traditional Konkani song ovi, which was usually sung at weddings''

''Most of the the traditional mandos, which gained the term “classical”, were composed in the 19th century. The polka and the valsavina (Vienna Waltz) with its three-four rhythm seem to have found their way to [[गोंय|Goa]]. The mando was originally composed and danced by the Brahmin aristocracy of [[गोंय|Goa]], mainly of Salcete, whose spacious mansions had a big hall for festive occasions. A memorable moment in the history of the family was the 
bridal mando. The mando reflects the tranquil and leisurely character of this aristocracy. The [[गोंय|Goa]]n woman in the mando reflects the ideals and virtues then ascribed to her, namely self-sacrifice, piety and motherhood.'' 

''As a dance the mando is a square type (double file), men facing the women. When the partners come face to face in the centre, they retreat to the starting point, then move forward again crossing to the opposite side. The men then flick their handkerchiefs while the women open their fans. All in all, it is a stately and leisurely dance. The melody of the mando is slow in movement, with a soft and languishing atmosphere.''
