Blessed Virgin,

Ankvar surekh sundori,

virgin fair and beautiful,

nam khôisoruch konn dusri

there is none like you,

Tujê samkar ravo-xi.

to be compared to you




Noketram-mokutt mathear,

With a crown of stars on your head,

sobit suria-vostr angar

clothed with thew bright sun,

chondrachi monnoi pãiank,

feet draped in the glow of the moon,

lili-ful Deva mukhar!

like a flower before [[God]]! 



Otmeam modem tum normôll

You are the purest among souls,

tum mhoji Mãi, samball kôr;

nitôll nirmollkai sundor.

pure, clean and beautiful.



Kirnnam tujea uzvaddachim

The rays of your light,

bhoddveank uzvaddaitat khorim,

how you illuminate the angels,

sorg-sonvsarak pavtat tim,

they spread over the earth and heaven,

suria-von porzollit tim.

they are brighter than

the rays of the sun. 



Lili-fula-i ki mogall

You are more lovable than the lotus,

Deva-borfa-ki uzall. 

whiter than the snow.

Zhuzant kortai tum xitôll

You bring peace where there is war,

diun tum adar puskôll!

By guiding us!

During temptations and in death.

Ankvar Maiê, pav vignant;

Virgin Mary, help us in time of trouble;

hea sonvsarant thaun sorgant

until we go up to heaven,

pavo-sôr mornna uprant.
