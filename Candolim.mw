'''Candolim''' is a [[census town]] in [[North Goa]]  in the state of [[Goa]], [[India]]. It is situated just south of the famous [[Calangute]] beach, and is popular tourist destination.

== History ==
During the late 16th century, Candolim became the first village to be entirely converted to [[Christianity]] in [[Bardez]] by the [[Franciscans]].<ref>{{harvnb|de Mendonça|2002|p=405}}</ref><ref name="Prabhu"/> The present Christian identity of its villagers dates back to the conversion of Santu Sinay ([[Shenoy]]), a ''ganvkar'' ([[Konkani language|Konkani]]: freeholder) who belonged to the nobility of his people.<ref name="Prabhu">{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=103}}</ref> 

Santu Sinay (1577–1640), was the son of Naru Sinay; who had earlier migrated from [[Loutolim]], [[Salcette]], and established himself in Candolim, where he purchased the fifth ''vangodd'' (clan) of the ''[[comunidade]]'' on 13 August 1604.<ref name="Naru">{{harvnb|da Cunha Rivara|Borges|da Cunha Soares|1996|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=vnKEgXtNHt0C&pg=PA269#v=onepage&q&f=false 269]}}</ref> Naru Sinay died after 1624, and was survived by his wife, four sons—Jeronimo de Souza, Manoel de Souza, Santu Sinay, and Christovão d'Andrade, and one daughter, Quiteria de Souza.<ref name="Naru"/> Santu Sinay was converted along with the rest of his family at the age of 8, and subsequently took the name of Salvador Pinto.<ref name="Naru"/> His godfather was Fr. Manoel Pinto, a [[Franciscan]] rector of the Church of Our Lady of Hope of Candolim and the seminary of [[Reis Magos]].<ref name="Naru"/> He was brought up in the seminary of Reis Magos, where he developed a great devotion to [[Francis Xavier|St. Francis Xavier]].<ref name="Santu"/> Salvador Pinto was tutored by two Franciscan priests, Fr. Pinto and Fr. Simão de Nazareth; who succeeded the former as rector of Candolim parish.<ref name="Naru"/> Salvador Pinto worked zealously to spread Christianity in the village.<ref name="Prabhu"/> Fr. de Nazareth held great influence with the Viceroys and in recognition of Salvador Pinto's tremendous work in converting the village, obtained for him many life grants and concessions which are still held by his descendants.<ref name="Santu"/> Fr. de Nazareth, as representative of Fr. Miguel de S. Bonaventura—Custodian and General Commissioner of East Indies and Diogo Dias, syndic of St. Francis and procurator of His Holiness—granted two perpetual graves in the Candolim Church, to Salvador Pinto and his father-in-law António Pereira in the transept, in front of the altar  of Bom Jesus, and also to his wife and mother-in-law, Maria and Catharina Pereira in the transept; her grave located between those of two parishioners, Pedro Sequeira and Francisco de Souza.<ref name="Santu">{{harvnb|da Cunha Rivara|Borges|da Cunha Soares|1996|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=vnKEgXtNHt0C&pg=PA270#v=onepage&q&f=false 270]}}</ref>

Candolim was the focal point of the [[Conspiracy of the Pintos|anti-Portuguese revolt of 1787]], also called the "Conspiracy of the Pintos", because it was spearheaded by priests belonging to the village's Pinto (Shenoy) clan.<ref>{{harvnb|de Souza|1989|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=ruTu9oaUgUgC&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false 110]}}</ref>

==Demographics==

==Candolim Beach==

[[File:Candolim Beach Goa.jpg|thumb|A normal day in Candolim Beach, [[Goa]]]]
Fifteen kilometers from Panjim, the Goan capital, is Candolim beach in north Goa. Beginning at Fort Aguada and merging with Calangute beach towards the end, it is one of the longest beaches in the state and is located in the Bardez taluka. The beach in itself is very calm and peaceful, at times tourists come here from Rajneesh Ashram in Pune to take a break. What adds to the scenic beauty of the sand and sea are the scrub covered dunes at the back of the beach quite popular with tourists. 

The main road that is the Candolim Calangute road is packed with shops and restaurants, but the beach front is rather free of any commercial activity apart from some water activities. Though the beach is close to bustling Calangute beach, life is rather laid back at Candolim. Even the village isn't very clustered, its quite spread out so there isn't any centre to it as such. The area around the beach can be termed as resort free as there aren't any resorts there. However, the beach has quite a number of inns at reasonable prices with good facilities.

Another interesting feature about the Candolim beach is the ship River Princess, which has been stuck at the shores of the beach since 2000.

== Aguada Fort ==
 
The fort was built by the Portuguese way back in 1612 for defense against the Dutch and the Maratha invaders. Along with the fort the church, lighthouse and the barracks of the Aguada Jail have become tourist attractions.
