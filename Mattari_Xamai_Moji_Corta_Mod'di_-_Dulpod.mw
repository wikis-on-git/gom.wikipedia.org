Looking behind and forward the old lady was making fuss,

Bend vancdem corun matari cholun vetali.

The old lady used to walk swaying her hips.

The old lady was showing her face making "hide and seek" with her sari,

Tanduanchem piit launum gôri pit zatali.

She was looking very fair (having powdered her face) with rice flour.
