Matari xamãi môji corta mod'di,

The old grandmother is putting on style,

Missa vetana galta tamdéli chôlli.

When she goes to church she puts on a red blouse.



Pattim fuddem chounum matari congré côri,

Looking behind and forward the old lady was making fuss,

Bend vancdem corun matari cholun vetali.

The old lady used to walk swaying her hips.



Appa lipa côrun matari tondd dacoitali,

The old lady was showing her face making "hide and seek" with her sari,

Tanduanchem piit launum gôri pit zatali.

She was looking very fair (having powdered her face) with rice flour.
