'''''Amen'''''

== Latin liturgical version ==

 Credo in unum Deum,
 Patrem omnipoténtem,
 Factórem cæli et terræ,
 Visibílium ómnium et invisibílium.
 Et in unum Dóminum Iesum Christum,
 Fílium Dei Unigénitum,
 Et ex Patre natum ante ómnia sæcula.
 Deum de Deo, lumen de lúmine, Deum verum de Deo vero,
 Génitum, non factum, consubstantiálem Patri:
 Per quem ómnia facta sunt.
 Qui propter nos hómines et propter nostram salútem
 Descéndit de cælis.
 Et incarnátus est de Spíritu Sancto
 Ex María Vírgine, et homo factus est.
 Crucifíxus étiam pro nobis sub Póntio Piláto;
 Passus, et sepúltus est,
 Et resurréxit tértia die, secúndum Scriptúras,
 Et ascéndit in cælum, sedet ad déxteram Patris.
 Et íterum ventúrus est cum glória,
 Iudicáre vivos et mórtuos,
 Cuius regni non erit finis.
 Et in Spíritum Sanctum, Dóminum et vivificántem:
 Qui ex Patre Filióque procédit.
 Qui cum Patre et Fílio simul adorátur et conglorificátur:
 Qui locútus est per prophétas.
 Et unam, sanctam, cathólicam et apostólicam Ecclésiam.
 Confíteor unum baptísma in remissiónem peccatorum.
 Et expecto resurrectionem mortuorum,
 Et vitam ventúri sæculi. Amen

==English translations==

The '''Apostles' Creed''' ([[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]]: ''Symbolum Apostolorum'' or ''Symbolum Apostolicum''), sometimes titled '''Symbol of the Apostles''', is an early statement of [[Kristanvponn|Christian]] belief, a [[creed]] or "symbol".n ot in the sense that the word "symbol" has in modern English, but in the original meaning of the word, derived from "Latin ''symbolum'', sign, token, from Greek σύμβολον, token for identification (by comparing with its counterpart), from συμβάλλειν, to throw together, compare"

he Apostles' Creed was based on Christian theological understanding of the [[Canonical gospels]], the letters of the [[New Testament]] and to a lesser extent the [[Old Testament]]. Its basis appears to be the old Roman Creed known also as the [[Old Roman Symbol]]. Because of the early origin of its original form, it does not address some [[Christology|Christological]] issues defined in the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] and other [[List of Christian creeds|Christian Creeds]]. It thus says nothing explicitly about the [[Divinity of Jesus|divinity]] of either [[[[God]] the Son|Jesus]] or of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]].

===Catholic Church===

The Catechism of the Catholic Church gives the following English translation of the Apostles' Creed. In its discussion of the Creed, the Catechism maintains the traditional division into twelve articles, the numbering of which is here added to the text.

# [[Credo|I believe]] in [[[[God]] the Father]] almighty, creator of [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]] and earth.
# I believe in [[Jezu|Jesus Christ]], his [[Monogenēs|only]] [[Son of [[God]]|Son]], our [[Kyrios (biblical term)|Lord]].
# He was conceived by the power of the [[Holy Spirit]] and born of the [[Virgin Mary]].
# Under [[Pontius Pilate]], He was crucified, died, and was buried.
# He [[Harrowing of Hell|descended to the dead]]. On the third day [[Resurrection of Jesus|he rose again]].
# He [[Ascension of Jesus|ascended into heaven]] and is [[Session of Christ|seated]] at the [[Right Hand of [[God]]|right hand of the Father]].
# He will [[Second Coming of Jesus|come again]] to [[Last judgment|judge the living and the dead]].
# I believe in the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]],
# the holy catholic Church, the [[communion of saints]],
# the forgiveness of [[sins]],
# the [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrection of the body]],
# and the [[Eternal life (Christianity)|life everlasting]].
:[[Amen]].

The English text used in the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] of the [[Roman Rite]] since 2011 is:
:I believe in [[God]],
:the Father almighty,
:Creator of heaven and earth,
:and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
:who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
:born of the Virgin Mary,
:suffered under Pontius Pilate,
:was crucified, died and was buried;
:he descended into hell;
:on the third day he rose again from the dead;
:he ascended into heaven,
:and is seated at the right hand of [[God]] the Father almighty;
:from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.
:I believe in the Holy Spirit,
:the holy catholic Church,
:the communion of saints,
:the forgiveness of sins,
:the resurrection of the body,
:and life everlasting. Amen.
