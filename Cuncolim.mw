'''Cuncolim''' is a city and a [[municipal council]] in [[South Goa district]] in the state of [[Goa]], [[India]].

==Etymology==
'''Kunkolle''' hea ganvank aplem nanv kumkumhali hea utrantlean mel'lam (hanga kumkum roitale). Ho ganv dokxin goychea [[Saxtti]] talukeant asa.<ref>[http://www.goacom.com/joel/news/2006jan/06jan06.htm News item from goacom.com website dated 06-Jan-2006]</ref>

==Geography==
Cuncolim is located at {{Coord|15.17|N|73.98|E|}}.<ref>[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/33/Cuncolim.html Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Cuncolim]</ref> It has an average elevation of 18&nbsp;metres (59&nbsp;feet).

==History==
It is a former village, now with a municipal council of its own, in the south Goa sub-district (''taluka'') of [[Salcette]], [[India]]. It is part of the AVC (Assolna-Velim-Cuncolim) network of villages.

Historically, there were twelve ''Vangodds'' (clans) of ''Ganvkars'' (landlords) in the village. Their names, in order of precedence, are as follows: Mhal, Shetcar, Naik, Mangro, Shet, Tombddo, Porobo, Sidakalo, Lokakalo, Bandekar, Rounom and Benklo.<ref name="Robinson">''Cuncolim: Weaving a tale of resistance.'', Rowena Robinson, Economic and Political Weekly, 1997, p. 334</ref>

Cuncolim was the site of recurring Hindu dissent against Portuguese rule, and this village is also known for an early violent protest against the Portuguese, in 1583. Those killed on the Christian side include the so called '[[martyrs of Cuncolim]]'.

The village of Cuncolim was the original site of the famous temple of Shree [[Shantadurga]] before this was demolished by the Portuguese in collaboration with the Christian missionaries. The Holy idol of Shree Shantadurga was taken to [[Fatorpa]] where the new temple of Shree [[Shantadurga]] Cuncolikarin stands today. The annual ''zatra'' of the temple happens in December /January where the ''Utsav'' which lasts for five days.

The chariots dipicting scenes of different Hindu mythylogoical events are paraded on each night. On the fifth day the Maha chariot of the Goddess is taken in a procession around the temple which is attended by devotees from all cast and creed from across Goa as well as the neighbouring states. This yatra is also attended by many local Christian families  who continue to hold sacred their familial allegiance to the [[Goddess]].

During the last days of the [[Holi]] festival, the idol of the Goddess is taken back to the original site at Cuncolim thus re-enacting the migration of the Goddess and many Hindu families who fled [[Salcette]] to preserve their faith. This marks the famous festival known as the Sontreo (Umbrellas) consisting 12 umbrellas representing 12 vangodds (clans) of Cuncolim.

Amongst those [[Hindu]] communities that fled Cuncolim in the midst of religious persecution are the [[Kunbi]]s, [[Gawdas]], [[Daivadnya]]s and Saraswats. The [[Saraswat]]s from Cuncolim and [[Quelossim]] formed a separate community called the [[Chitrapur Saraswats]] and they have their ''math'' head quarters in [[Chitrapur]], [[Karnataka]].

==Demographics==
