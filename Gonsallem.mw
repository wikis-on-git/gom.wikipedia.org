'''''Gonsallem'''''
is a type of fibrous fruit called “towel gourds” because they were used as flesh rubbers
when having a bath. Gonsallem is the Luffa acutangula or Luffa amara. Its leaves have five to seven
lobes, and are softly hairy when young. Its flowers are middle-sized and bright yellow. The fruit has ten
sharp ridges, growing on a plant which is a steady climber, sometimes found in hedges. Its flowers open in
the afternoon.
