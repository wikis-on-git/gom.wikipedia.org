'''Dekhṇi''' (also spelled Dekni, Dekni, Dekhṇi) is a semi [[ballet|classical]] [[Goa]]n ([[India]]n) dance form. The plural of dekṇi in Konkani remains the same.

One of the most famous Deknni songs is ''Hanv Saiba Poltodi Vetam'' by Carlos Eugenio Ferreira (1860–1926) first published in [[Paris]] in 1895 and then in Goa in 1926. The song was adapted by [[Raj Kapoor]] as ''Na mangoon sona chandi'' in his [[Hindi]] movie [[Bobby (1973 film)|Bobby]].<ref name="r111-112"/> The story that is depicted in this song is about two temple dancers who want to go for Damu's wedding and they approach the boatman to ferry them across the river. The boatman says, "No! The river is rough!" The dancers offer the boatman their gold jewellery; but the boatman is still firm. "No!" he says. So the dancers dance for the boatman and this time he ferries them across the river.{{cn|date=August 2012}}

One of the earliest deknnis which may be dated around 1869 is ''[[Kuxttoba]]'' in which he is called “heir to India and terror of Goa”, implying resistance to Portuguese rule. Kuxttoba was a member of the Salekar branch of the Rane family. Information about his birth, the reason and the course of his rebellion and the manner of his end are vague. He did rebel as an individual against the rule of the Portuguese in Goa but he presented no concept for a free Goa.
