Mhozo poti Bomoi guela,

My husband has gone to Mumbai,

Tacho usko mhaka zala,

I am worried about him,

Ani nimanne rati sopeacher boson,

On the last day, sitting on the balcony seat,

Beij(u) mhaka dila.

He had kissed me.



'''Chusmo/Refrain:'''


Poti ie, poti ie,

Come my husband, come,

Tujea gopant mhaka gue.

Take me in your arms.



Khattir eksurim hanv loutam,

I lie on the bed in loneliness,

Sopnant tujea kuxik pautam,

I am next to you in my dreams,

Ani tunch mhunnun poti unxeak rê mhojea,

And thinking it to be you, my husband,

Vengent gheun leumtam.

I embrace the pillow. '''(Chusmo/Refrain)'''



Poti gopant mhaka dori,

My husband would embrace me,

Ak´khi rat-bhor chimtte kaddi,

He would pinch me the whole night long,

Ani thambonastanam khobro sangtaloi,

And you would talk to me unceasingly,

[[God]]d(i), godd(i), godd(i).

Sweet, sweet, sweet talk. '''(Chusmo/Refrain)'''



Kuttumb ghoddunk vell lainaka,

Do not waste time in building (Do not delay to build up) a family,

Veguim Bomoi vhor rê mhaka,

Take me soon to Mumbai,

Kalliz hem mhojem, axeta poti,

My heart is longing, my husband,

Gopant raunk tujea.

To be in your arms. '''(Chusmo/Refrain)'''



Mhojea poti-xim vetelim,

I will go to my husband,

Ak´khem voros-bhor rautelim,

I will stay with him for a year,

Ani dogaim assanv tim tegam zatokoch,

When the two of us become three,

Ghara ietelim.

I will return home . '''(Chusmo/Refrain)'''
