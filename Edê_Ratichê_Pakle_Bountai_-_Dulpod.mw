Edê ratichê pakle bountai

The whites (Portuguese) are roaming about so late at night

Khaddache,

Bearded ones,

Ani main(u) mhojea filoz kelai

My mother has made fritters

[[God]]dache.

Of molasses (jauggery).



Konn sang(o)lta Bhonsule,

Who will inform the Bhounsules,

Ietai mhunn chorunk(o),

That they are coming to pilfer,

Corneti funkun Bhonsule,

Blowing the trumpet, the Bhounsules,

Ietai mhunn gharanko.

Are coming to their houses. (to guard them)



Edê ratichê pakle bountai

The whites (Portuguese) are roaming about so late at night

Khaddache,

Bearded ones,

Ani main(u) mhojea filoz kelai

And my mother has made fritters

[[God]]dache.

Of molasses (jaggery)
