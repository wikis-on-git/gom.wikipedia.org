Bhurgea-bhoktin zomleanv,

We are born innocent children,

gaion korun ietanv,

we are coming, singing a song,

visvas dhorun ietanv,

we come with full faith,

Bapa mukhar ietanv.

we are coming to our Father.


Refrain:

Atmean, sotan, Bapa,

With a true trusting spirit, O Father,

bhozunk ietanv Tuka!

coming to worship You!



Jezuk modem dovrun,

With Jesus in our midst,

Jezuk mukhar ghalun,

by having Jesus before us,

Jezuk chikttun ravun,

by keeping Jesus in mind,

Bapa mukhar ietanv.

we come before our Father.


Tachem Utor aikunk,

To hear His word,

Taka orponn korunk,

to praise Him,

Tachea jevnnak bosunk

to sit at His table,

kuxalkaien ietanv.

we come full of happiness.


Bhavam-bhoinnim vangdda

In the company of our brothers and sisters,

What a privilege for us,

Bapa mukhar ieunchem,

to stand before our Father,

bhavam-bhoinnim modem

with our brothers and sisters,

Jezu sarkim zaunchem!

let us become like Jesus.
