'''Hail Mary''' 



The '''Hail Mary''', also commonly called the '''Ave Maria''' ([[Latin]]) or '''Angelic Salutation''', is a traditional Catholic [[prayer]] asking for the [[Intercession of saints|intercession]] of the [[Maria|Virgin Mary]], the mother of Jesus. In [[Katolik firgoz|Roman Catholicism]], the prayer forms the basis of the [[Rosary]] and the [[Angelus]] prayers. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], a similar prayer is used in formal liturgies, both in Greek and in translations. It is also used by many other groups within the [[Katolik firgoz|Catholic]] tradition of Christianity including [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], Independent Catholics, and [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholics]]. Some [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations, such as [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], also make use of a form of the prayer.

Based on the greeting of the angel [[Gabriel]] to the Virgin Mary in the [[Luka Pormannem Jezu Kristachem Xubhvortoman|Gospel of Luke]], the prayer takes different forms in various traditions. It has often been set to music, although the most famous musical expression of the words ''Ave Maria'' by [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] does not actually contain the Hail Mary prayer.

The Hail Mary is the essential element of the [[Rosary]], a prayer method in use especially among [[Latin Rite]] (Western) Catholics. The [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] say a similar version of the Hail Mary. The Rosary consists traditionally of three sets of five Mysteries, each mystery consisting of one "decade" or ten Ave Marias. The 150 Ave Marias of the Rosary thus echo the 150 psalms. These meditate upon events of Jesus' life during his childhood (Joyful Mysteries), Passion (Sorrowful Mysteries), and from his Resurrection onwards (Glorious Mysteries). Another set, the Luminous Mysteries, is of comparatively recent origin, having been proposed by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2002. Each of these Mysteries is prayed as a decade (a unit of ten), consisting of one [[Lord's Prayer|Our Father]] (''Pater Noster'' or ''The Lord's Prayer''), ten Hail Marys, and one '[[Glory Be to the Father|Glory Be]]' (''Gloria Patri'') ([[Doxology]]).

The Hail Mary is also the central part of the [[Angelus]], a devotion generally recited thrice daily by many Catholics, as well as some Anglicans and Lutherans.


In English:

:Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
:Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
