'''''Amen'''''

== Confiteor ==


The '''''Confiteor''''' (so named from its first word, or ''[[incipit]]'', in Latin, meaning "I confess" or "I acknowledge") is one of the prayers that can be said during the [[Penitential Act]] at the beginning of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] of the [[Roman Rite]] in the [[Catholic Church]]. It is also said in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]] at the beginning of their [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]], and by some [[Anglo-catholic]] [[Anglicans]] before Mass. The prayer is started by the Priest and ended by the people.
This prayer is referred to as the "absolution", a prayer for forgiveness, not a granting of forgiveness as in the Sacrament of Penance. It is therefore classified as a [[sacramentals|sacramental]], not a [[sacrament]].

==Usage in Catholicism==


The text of the Confiteor in the 1970 Missal is as follows

::'''Text in Latin'''
:
:Confiteor Deo omnipotenti,
:et vobis fratres,
:quia peccavi nimis
:cogitatione, verbo,
:opere et omissione:
:mea culpa, mea culpa,
:mea maxima culpa.
:Ideo precor beatam Mariam semper Virginem,
:omnes Angelos et Sanctos,
:et vos, fratres,
:orare pro me ad Dominum Deum nostrum.


::'''Official English translation'''
:
:I confess to almighty [[God]]
:and to you, my brothers and sisters,
:that I have greatly sinned,
:in my thoughts and in my words,
:in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,
:through my fault, through my fault,
:through my most grievous fault;
:therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,
:all the Angels and Saints,
:and you, my brothers and sisters,
:to pray for me to the Lord our [[God]].
