'''Sokanny'm furhem uttun cherh'm (cheddum) muj'm (mujem)'''

Rising up early in the morning, my girl,

San-nim mat-talem

Was sweeping the floor.

Sannam sannam sannam (sannam) sa!

(This is how it sounded:) Sanam, sannam, sannam, (sannam), sa!

Tem maka deknam furhem (fuddem),

No sooner did she see me,

San-nintum nipolem.

Then she hid in the broom.



Sokanny'm furhem uttun cherh'm muj'm,

Rising up early in the morning, my girl,

Vatlleo ganxtalem.

Was scrubbing the dishes.

Sannam sannam sannam (sannam) sa!

(This is how it sounded:) Sannam, sannam, sannam, (sannam), sa!

Tem maka deknam furhem,

No sooner did she see me,

Vatllintum nipolem.

When she hid behind the plates.



Sokanny'm furhem uttun cherh'm muj'm,

Rising up early in the morning, my girl,

Tambyo ganxtalem.

She was scrubbing the little copper pot.

Sannam sannam sannam sa!

(This is how it sounded:) Sannam, sannam, sannam, sa!

Tem maka deknam furhem,

No sooner did she see me,

Tambyantum nipolem.

When she hid inside the pot.



Cherh'm cher'm cher'm cumparilem,

The girl, my mate's girl,

Cherh'm cumparilem.

My comrade's girl.

Chintloly'm (chintlolem) kam zaly'm (zalem) ga mugelem.

I got from her what I wanted (lit. the work I had thought of happened).
