Bailegeri xinkrum zata,

There is excitement in the lady's house

Taka matre polleat.

Old men are falling for her.

Bailegeri xinkrum zata,

There is excitement in the lady's house

Taka matre polleat.

And old men are falling for her.



Bailu mhuji bhurgi dekhun,

Because my wife is young,

Tika matxe samballiatu.

Please take care of her.
