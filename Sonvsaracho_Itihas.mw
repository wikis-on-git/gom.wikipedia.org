The [[Cradle of civilization|roots of civilization]] reach back to the earliest introduction of primitive technology and culture, while [[Prehistory]] begins in the [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic Era]], or "Early Stone Age", which is followed by the [[Neolithic|Neolithic Era]], or "New Stone Age", and the [[Neolithic Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] (between 8000 and 5000 [[BCE]]) in the [[Fertile Crescent]].

===Rise of civilization===
[[File:Sumerian 26th c Adab.jpg|thumb|[[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform]], the earliest known writing system]]
The [[Neolithic Revolution]], beginning about 8,000 BCE, saw the development of agriculture, which drastically changed the human lifestyle. [[Mesopotamia]] is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution. It has been identified as having "inspired some of the most important developments in human history including the invention of the [[wheel]], the planting of the first cereal [[crop]]s and the development of [[cursive]] script, [[Mathematics]], [[Astronomy]] and [[Agriculture]]."<ref name="historyandpolicy">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-13.html|title=Iraq, past, present and future: a thoroughly-modern mandate?|last=Milton-Edwards|first=Beverley|date=May 2003|work=History & Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010}}</ref>

Farming permitted far denser populations, which in time organized into [[State (polity)|states]]. Agriculture also created [[food]] surpluses that could support people not directly engaged in food production. The development of agriculture permitted the creation of the first [[city|cities]]. These were centres of [[trade]], [[manufacturing]] and [[political power]] with nearly no agricultural production of their own. Cities established a [[symbiosis]] with their surrounding [[Rural area|countryside]]s, absorbing agricultural products and providing, in return, manufactured goods and varying degrees of military control and protection.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Stearns | first1 = Peter N. | authorlink1 = Peter Stearns |first2=William L. | last2= Langer | title = [[Encyclopedia of World History|The Encyclopedia of World History: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern, Chronologically Arranged]] | publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin Company]] | date = 24 September 2001 | isbn = 0-395-65237-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Tertius|title=Four thousand years of urban growth: an historical census|date=1987|publisher=St. David's University Press|location=Lewiston, NY|isbn=9780889462076}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Modelski|first1=George|authorlink1=George Modelski|title=World cities: -3000 to 2000|date=2003|publisher=Faros 2000|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780967623016}}</ref>

As complex civilizations arose, so did complex [[religion]]s, and the first of their kind apparently originated during this period.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zhu|first1=Tianshu|editor1-last=Compareti|editor1-first=Matteo|editor2-last=Raffetta|editor2-first=Paola|editor3-last=Scarcia|editor3-first=Gianroberto|title=Ērān ud Anērān: studies presented to Boris Ilich Maršak on the occasion of his 70th birthday|date=2006|publisher=Cafoscarina|location=Venice|isbn=8875431051|chapter=The Sun God and the Wind Deity at Kizil|chapterurl=http://www.transoxiana.org/Eran/Articles/tianshu.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Gimbutas|first1=Marija|authorlink1=Marija Gimbutas|title=The language of the goddess: unearthing the hidden symbols of western civilization|date=1989|publisher=Harper & Row|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-06-250356-1}}</ref> Entities such as the Sun, Moon, Earth, sky, and sea were often deified.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Patricia|last2=Coulter|first2=Charles Russell|title=Dictionary of ancient deities|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195145045}}</ref> [[Shrine]]s developed, which evolved into [[temple]] establishments, complete with a complex hierarchy of [[Priest|priests and priestesses]] and other functionaries.

During this era the most fertile areas of the world saw [[city-state]]s and the [[Cradle of civilization|first civilizations]] develop. These were concentrated in fertile river valleys: the [[Tigris–Euphrates river system|Tigris and Euphrates]] in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Nile]] in [[Egypt]], the [[Indus River|Indus]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River]] in [[China]].

[[Sumer]], located in [[Mesopotamia]], is arguably the first known complex civilization,<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Sumer and Akkad|last=King|first=Leonid W.|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=1522847308|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> developing the first [[city-state]]s in the 4th millennium BCE. It was in these cities that the earliest known form of writing, [[cuneiform script]], appeared c. 3000 BCE.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Empires of the Plain: Henry Rawlinson and the Lost Languages of Babylon|last=Adkins|first=Lesley|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2003|isbn=0-312-33002-2|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Cuneiform writing began as a system of [[pictography|pictographs]]. These pictorial representations eventually became simplified and more abstract. Cuneiform texts were written on [[clay tablet]]s, on which [[symbol]]s were drawn with a blunt [[Phragmites|reed]] used as a [[stylus]]. Writing made the administration of a large state far easier.

Transport was facilitated by waterways—by rivers and seas. The [[Mediterranean Sea]], at the juncture of three continents, fostered the projection of military power and the exchange of goods, ideas, and inventions. This era also saw new land technologies, such as horse-based cavalry and chariots, that allowed armies to move faster.

These developments led to the rise of [[empire]]s. Such extensive civilizations brought peace and stability over wider areas. The first empire, controlling a large territory and many cities, developed in Egypt with the unification of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]] c. 3100 BCE,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt|last=Shaw|first=Ian|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-19-280458-8|location=|pages=78–80|quote=|via=}}</ref> while in [[Crete]] the [[Minoan civilization]] had entered the Bronze Age by 2700 BCE and is regarded as the first civilization in Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World of Ancient Times|last=Roebuck|first=Carl|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|year=1966|isbn=|location=New York|pages=101|quote=|via=}}</ref> Over the next millennia, other river valleys would see monarchical empires rise to power.

Over the following millennia, civilizations would develop across the world. [[Trade]] would increasingly become a source of power as states with access to important resources or controlling important trade routes would rise to dominance. In c. 2500 BCE, the [[Kerma Culture]] developed in [[Sudan]], south of Egypt.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hafsaas-Tsakos|first=Henriette|year=2009|title=The Kingdom of Kush: An African Centre on the Periphery of the Bronze Age World System|url=https://www.academia.edu/2380609/The_Kingdom_of_Kush_An_African_Centre_on_the_Periphery_of_the_Bronze_Age_World_System|journal=Norwegian Archaeological Review|volume=42|pages=50–70|via=|doi=10.1080/00293650902978590}}</ref> In modern Turkey the [[Hittites]] controlled a large empire and by 1600 BCE, [[Mycenaean Greece]] began to develop.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chadwick|first1=John|authorlink1=John Chadwick|title=The Mycenaean world|date=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-29037-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Mylonas|first1=George E.|authorlink1=George E.

As complex civilizations arose in the Eastern Hemisphere, most indigenous societies in the [[Americas]] remained relatively simple for some time, fragmented into diverse regional cultures. During the [[formative stage]] in [[Mesoamerica]], (about 1500 BCE to 500 CE), more complex and centralized civilizations began to develop, mostly in what is now Mexico, Central America, and Peru. They include civilizations such as the [[Olmec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Moche culture|Moche]], and [[Nazca culture|Nazca]]. They developed agriculture as well, growing maize and other crops unique to the Americas, and creating a distinct culture and religion. These ancient indigenous societies would be greatly affected by European contact during the early modern period.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Method and Theory in American Archaeology|last=Phillips|first=Philip|last2=Willey|first2=Gordon R.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1957|isbn=9780226898889|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>

===Axial Age===
{{Main article|Axial Age|History of philosophy|Timeline of religion|History of religions}}
Beginning in the 8th century BCE, the "[[Axial Age]]" saw the development of a set of transformative philosophical and religious ideas, mostly independently, in many different places.  Chinese [[Confucianism]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Confucianism

([[Karl Jaspers]]' Axial-Age theory also includes [[Persia]]n [[Zoroastrianism]], but other scholars dispute his timeline for Zoroastrianism.)  In the 5th century BCE, [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]] made substantial advances in the development of [[ancient Greek philosophy]].

In the East, three schools of thought would dominate [[China|Chinese]] thinking until the modern day. These were [[Taoism]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=James|title=Daoism: a short introduction|date=2003|publisher=Oneworld|location=Oxford|isbn=1-85168-315-1}}</ref> [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/China/China%20Legalism.htm |title=Chinese Legalism: Documentary Materials and Ancient Totalitarianism |work=World Future Fund |accessdate=18 April 2009}}</ref> and [[Confucianism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interfaith.org/confucianism/|title=Confucianism|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Brite Media|work=Interfaith Online|accessdate=31 May 2016}}</ref> The Confucian tradition, which would become particularly dominant, looked for [[Politics|political]] [[morality]] not to the force of law but to the power and example of [[tradition]].  Confucianism would later spread to the [[Korean Peninsula]] and toward [[Japan]].

In the West, the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophical tradition, represented by [[Socrates]],<ref name="enc1911">{{EB1911|noprescript=1|wstitle=Socrates}}</ref> [[Plato]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kraut|first1=Richard|title=Plato|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=1 January 2015}}</ref> [[Aristotle]],<ref>{{Catholic|no-icon=1|prescript=|wstitle=Aristotle|volume=1|first=William|last=Turner|authorlink=William Turner (bishop of Buffalo)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/a/aristotl.htm|title=Aristotle (384—322 B.C.E.)|last=|first=|date=|publisher=University of Tennessee at Martin|work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=18 April 2009}}</ref> and other philosophers, along with accumulated science, technology, and culture, diffused throughout [[Europe]], Egypt, the [[Middle East]], and Northwest India, starting in the 4th century BCE after the conquests of Alexander III of [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedon]] ([[Alexander the Great]]).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Heckel|first1=Waldemar|title=Bibliography of Alexander the Great|url=http://hum.ucalgary.ca/wheckel/bibl/alex-bibl.pdf|publisher=University of Calgary|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114193802/http://hum.ucalgary.ca/wheckel/bibl/alex-bibl.pdf|archivedate=14 January 2009|date=2 October 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~stephan/Animation/alexander.html |title=The odyssey of Alexander the Great|publisher=Western Washington University|accessdate=18 April 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080615021840/http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~stephan/Animation/alexander.html |archivedate = 15 June 2008}}</ref>

===Regional empires===
{{Main article|Civilization|Empire}}
The millennium from 500 BCE to 500 CE saw a series of empires of unprecedented size develop. Well-trained professional armies, unifying ideologies, and advanced bureaucracies created the possibility for emperors to rule over large domains whose populations could attain numbers upwards of tens of millions of subjects.
The great [[empire]]s depended on [[military]] [[annexation]] of territory and on the formation of defended settlements to become agricultural centres.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Lewis Henry|title=Ancient society; or, researches in the lines of human progress from savagery, through barbarism to civilization|date=1877|publisher=Henry Holt|location=New York|url=https://archive.org/details/ancientsociety00morg}}</ref> The relative peace that the empires brought encouraged [[international trade]], most notably the massive trade routes in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], the maritime trade web in the Indian Ocean, and the [[Silk Road]]. In southern Europe, the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] (and later the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]), in an era known as "[[classical antiquity]]," established cultures whose practices, laws, and customs are considered the foundation of contemporary [[Western culture]].

Major regional empires of this period include:

===Declines, falls and resurgence===
The empires faced common problems associated with maintaining huge armies and supporting a central bureaucracy. These costs fell most heavily on the [[peasant]]ry, while land-owning [[magnate]]s increasingly evaded centralized control and its costs. [[Barbarian]] pressure on the frontiers hastened internal dissolution. [[China]]'s [[Han dynasty]] fell into [[civil war]] in 220 CE, beginning the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, while its [[Roman Empire|Roman]] counterpart became increasingly decentralized and divided about the same time in what is known as the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. The great empires of Eurasia were all located on temperate and subtropical coastal plains. From the [[Central Asia]]n steppes, horse-based nomads (mainly Mongols and Turks) dominated a large part of the continent. The development of the [[stirrup]] and the breeding of horses strong enough to carry a fully armed archer made the nomads a constant threat to the more settled civilizations.

Over the course of history, [[Polity|polities]] have tended to develop by accretion or takeover, variously amicable or hostile, and have often disintegrated. The histories even of now small countries often show earlier periods of [[Imperialism|imperialist]] expansion. The [[Roman Empire]] is merely one of the more memorable and paradigmatic examples of political expansion and contraction.<ref>{{cite book|first=G.W.|last=Trompf|title=The Idea of [[Historic recurrence|Historical Recurrence]] in Western Thought, from Antiquity to the Reformation|isbn=9780520034792|location=Berkeley|publisher=University of California Press|year=1979}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Kennedy|authorlink=Paul Kennedy|title=[[The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers]]: Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000|location=New York|publisher=Random House|year=1987|isbn=0-394-54674-1}}</ref> The [[Chinese Empire]], on the other hand, is an example of long-term political expansion and persistence—of an empire which recovered from all its declines and falls, and which challenges the paradigm of inevitable permanent imperial fall.<ref>{{cite book|first=Yuri|last=Pines|authorlink=Yuri Pines|title=Envisioning Eternal Empire: Chinese Political Thought of the Warring States Era|location=Honolulu|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2009|isbn=9780824832759}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Yuri|last=Pines|title=The Everlasting Empire: The Political Culture of Ancient China and Its Imperial Legacy|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780691134956}}</ref>

A champion of [[world history]], [[Arnold J. Toynbee|Arnold Toynbee]], concludes that the history of the world is not just a cycle of expansions and contractions. The cycle proceeds on a ''spatially'' growing scale. Formerly expansive countries become small relative to greater countries that arise on the periphery. In any historical system, "it had been common form for the states at the centre to be pigmies by comparison with the relatively gigantic size of the states on the periphery, and for the central area ... to be the arena into which the surrounding giants descend to meet and do battle with one another." The "abrupt changes of scale" have brought into existence new constellations of states. The "pigmies of today were apt to be the giants of yesterday." Examples are from the [[Axial Age|Axial]] Mediterranean and China, and early modern Italy. These "examples of ''peripeteia''—the reversal of roles—in the play of the balance of power conform to a uniform pattern; and in Western history, by the time of writing [1954], this pattern of events had repeated itself."<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Study of History|last=Toynbee|first=Arnold|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1954|isbn=|volume=9|location=London|pages=486–487|quote=|via=}}</ref>

==Post-classical history==
{{Main article|Post-classical history}}
The Postclassical Era is named for the more Eurocentric era of "[[Classical antiquity]]," but "the Postclassical Era" refers to a more global outline. The era is commonly dated from the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century. The Western Roman Empire fragmented into numerous separate kingdoms, many of which would be later confederated under the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Eastern Roman, or [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], Empire survived until late in the Middle Ages. The Postclassical period also corresponds to the [[Early Muslim conquests]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Fred|last=Donner|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/donner.html|title=The Early Islamic Conquests|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1981|isbn=1597402001}}</ref> the subsequent [[Islamic Golden Age]],<ref>{{cite web|first=Gaston|last=Wiet|url=http://trboard.org/modules/makale/makale.php?id=57|title=Golden age of Arab and Islamic Culture|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222025752/http://trboard.org/modules/makale/makale.php?id=57|archivedate=22 December 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theislamproject.org/education/B04_SpreadofIslam.htm |title=Overview of Muslim History |publisher=The Islam Project |accessdate=18 April 2009}}</ref> and the commencement and expansion of the [[Arab slave trade]], followed by the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol invasions]] in the Middle East and Central Asia, and the founding (1299)<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey|last=Shaw|first=Stanford|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1976|isbn=|volume=1|location=Cambridge|pages=13|quote=|via=}}</ref> of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[South Asia]] saw a series of [[middle kingdoms of India]], followed by the establishment of [[Islamic empires in India]]. In western Africa, the [[Mali Empire]] and the [[Songhai Empire]] developed. On the southeast coast of Africa, Arabic ports were established where [[gold]], [[Spice trade|spices]], and other commodities were traded. This allowed Africa to join the [[Southeast Asia]] trading system, bringing it contact with Asia; this, along with Muslim culture, resulted in the [[Swahili culture]]. The [[Mid-Imperial China|Chinese Empire]] experienced the successive [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]], [[Tang dynasty|Tang]], [[Song dynasty|Song]], [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]], and the beginning of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] Dynasty. Middle Eastern trade routes along the Indian Ocean, and the [[Silk Road]] through the Gobi Desert, provided limited economic and cultural contact between Asian and European civilizations. During this same period, civilizations in the Americas, such as the [[Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and [[Aztec]], reached their height. All would be seriously compromised by contact with [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]] at the beginning of the [[Modern history|Modern period]].

===Western Asia and North Africa===
{{Main article|History of the Middle East#The medieval Near East|Islamic Golden Age}}
Prior to the advent of Islam in the 7th century, the Middle East was dominated by the [[Byzantine Empire]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Byzantine-Empire|title=Byzantine Empire|last=Nicol|first=Donald MacGillivray|last2=Teall|first2=John L.|date=December 23, 2015|website=|publisher=Encyclopaedia Brittanica|access-date=November 22, 2016}}</ref> and the Persian [[Sasanian Empire]],<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> which constantly fought each other for control of disputed regions such as [[Armenia]]. This was also a cultural battle, with the Byzantine Hellenistic and Christian culture competing against the Persian Iranian traditions and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian religion]]. The formation of the [[History of Islam|Islamic religion]] created a new contender that quickly surpassed both of these empires. Islam overall greatly impacted the [[political history|political]], [[economic history|economic]], and [[military history]] of the [[Old World]], especially the [[Middle East]].

The knowledge and skills of the ancient Middle East, of Greece, and of Persia were preserved in the Postclassical Era by Muslims, who also added new and important innovations from outside, such as the manufacture of paper from China and decimal positional numbering from India. Much of this learning and development can be linked to geography. Even prior to Islam's presence the city of Mecca had served as a centre of trade in Arabia, and the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] himself was a merchant. With the new Islamic tradition of the ''[[Hajj]]'', the pilgrimage to Mecca, the city became even more a centre for exchanging goods and ideas. The influence held by Muslim merchants over African-Arabian and Arabian-Asian trade routes was tremendous. As a result, Islamic civilization grew and expanded on the basis of its merchant economy, in contrast to the Europeans, Indians, and Chinese who based their societies on an agricultural landholding nobility. Merchants brought goods and their faith to [[Islam in China|China]], [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent|India]], [[Islam in Southeast Asia|southeast Asia]], and the kingdoms of western [[Islam in Africa|Africa]], and returned with new discoveries and inventions.

Motivated by religion and dreams of conquest, the kings of Europe launched a number of [[Crusades]] to try to roll back Muslim power and retake the [[Holy Land]]. The Crusades were ultimately unsuccessful, and served more to weaken the [[Byzantine Empire]] especially with the [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|sack of Constantinople]] in 1204, which began to lose increasing amounts of territory to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]]. Arab domination of the region ended in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]], migrating south from the Turkic homelands in [[Central Asia]]. In the early 13th century, a new wave of invaders, the [[Mongols|Mongol]] armies of the [[Mongol Empire]], swept through the region, but were eventually eclipsed by the Turks and the founding of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1299.<ref name=":4" />

[[File:Alcazar05 5-4-04.JPG|thumb|[[Castle]]s like [[Alcázar of Segovia|Segovia Castle]], [[Spain]], were common in [[High Middle Ages]] Europe.]]

Europe during the [[Early Middle Ages]] was characterized by depopulation, deurbanization, and [[barbarian]] invasion, all of which had begun in [[Late Antiquity]]. The barbarian invaders formed their own new kingdoms in the remains of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. In the 7th century, [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], once part of the eastern empire, became part of the [[Caliphate]] after conquest by [[Muhammad]]'s successors. Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures, the break was not as extreme as once put forth by historians, with most of the new kingdoms incorporating as many of the existing Roman institutions as they could. Christianity expanded in western Europe and monasteries were founded. In the 7th and 8th centuries the [[Franks]], under the [[Carolingian dynasty]], established an empire covering much of western Europe;<ref>{{Cite book|title=Byzantium: A World Civilization|last=Laiou|first=Angeliki|last2=Maguire|first2=Henry P.|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks|year=1992|isbn=978-0-88402-200-8|location=|pages=62|quote=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Earth and Its Peoples|last=Bulliett|first=Richard W. et alii|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2011|isbn=978-0-495-91310-8|location=|pages=333|quote=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Frankist World|last=Nelson|first=Janet L.|publisher=Continuum International|year=2003|isbn=978-1-85285-105-7|location=|pages=xii|quote=|via=}}</ref> it lasted until the 9th century, when it succumbed to pressure from new invaders&nbsp;– the [[Vikings]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Viking-people|title=Viking|last=|first=|date=February 8, 2015|website=|publisher=Encyclopaedia Brittanica|access-date=November 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Vikings|last=Roesdahl|first=Else|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1998|isbn=978-0140252828|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> [[Hungarians#Entering the Carpathian Basin .28c. 895.29|Magyars]], and [[Saracen]]s.

During the [[High Middle Ages]], which began after 1000, the population of Europe increased greatly as new technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and crop yields to increase. [[Manorialism]]&nbsp;– the organization of peasants into villages that owed rents and labour service to nobles&nbsp;– and [[feudalism]]&nbsp;– a political structure whereby [[knight]]s and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rents from lands and [[manor]]s&nbsp;– were two of the ways of organizing medieval society that developed during the High Middle Ages. Kingdoms became more centralized after the decentralizing effects of the breakup of the [[Carolingian Empire]]. The [[Crusades]], which were first preached in 1095, were an attempt by western Christians to regain control of the [[Holy Land]] from the [[Muslim]]s, and succeeded long enough to establish some Christian states in the Near East. Intellectual life was marked by [[scholasticism]] and the founding of universities, while the building of [[Gothic cathedrals]] was one of the outstanding artistic achievements of the age.

{{Main article|History of Africa}}
Medieval [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] was home to many different civilizations. The [[Kingdom of Aksum]] declined in the 7th century as Islam cut it off from its Christian allies and its people moved further into the [[Ethiopian Highlands]] for protection. They eventually gave way to the [[Zagwe dynasty]] who are famed for their rock cut architecture at [[Lalibela]]. The Zagwe would then fall to the [[Solomonic dynasty]] who claimed descent from the Aksumite emperors{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} and would rule the country well into the 20th century. In the [[West Africa]]n [[Sahel]] region, many Islamic empires rose, such as the [[Ghana Empire]], the [[Mali Empire]], the [[Songhai Empire]], and the [[Kanem Empire]]. They controlled the [[trans-Saharan trade]] in gold, ivory, salt and slaves.

South of the Sahel civilizations rose in the coastal forests where horses and camels could not survive. These include the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] city of [[Ife]] (noted for its naturalistic art<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blier|first=Suzanne Preston|year=2012|title=Art in Ancient Ife, Birthplace of the Yoruba|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/blier/files/blier.pdf|journal=African Arts|volume=45|pages=70–85|via=|doi=10.1162/afar_a_00029}}</ref>) and the [[Oyo Empire]], the [[Benin Empire]] of the [[Edo people]] centred in [[Benin City]], the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] [[Kingdom of Nri]] which produced advanced bronze art at [[Igbo-Ukwu]], and the [[Akan people|Akan]] who are noted for their intricate architecture.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In what is now modern [[Zimbabwe]] various kingdoms evolved from the [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]] in modern [[South Africa]]. They flourished through trade with the [[Swahili people]] on the [[East Africa]]n coast. They built large defensive stone structures without mortar such as [[Great Zimbabwe]], capital of the [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]], [[Khami]], capital of [[Kingdom of Butua]], and [[Danangombe]] (Dhlo-Dhlo), capital of the [[Rozwi Empire]]. The [[Swahili people]] themselves were the inhabitants of the East African coast from Kenya to Mozambique who traded extensively with Asians and Arabs, who introduced them to Islam. They built many port cities such as [[Mombasa]], [[Zanzibar]], and [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], which were known to Chinese sailors under [[Zheng He]] and Islamic geographers.

===Southeast Asia===
The beginning of the Middle Ages in [[Southeast Asia]] saw the fall (550 CE) of the [[Funan (Southeast Asia)|Kingdom of Funan]] to the [[Chenla|Chenla Empire]], which was then replaced by the [[Khmer Empire]] (802 CE). The Khmer's capital city [[Angkor]] was the largest city in the world prior to the industrial age and contained over a thousand temples, the most famous being [[Angkor Wat]]. The [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] (1238 CE) and [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] (1351 CE) kingdoms were major powers of the [[Thai people]], who were influenced by the Khmer. Starting in the 9th century, the [[Pagan Kingdom]] rose to prominence in modern [[Myanmar]]. Other notable kingdoms of the period include the [[Srivijaya|Srivijayan Empire]] and the [[Lavo Kingdom]] (both coming into prominence in the 7th century), the [[Champa]] and the [[Hariphunchai]] (both about 750), the [[Dai Viet]] (968), [[Lan Na]] (13th century), [[Majapahit]] (1293), [[Lan Xang]] (1354), and the [[Kingdom of Ava]] (1364). It was also during this period that [[Islam]] spread to present-day [[Indonesia]] (beginning in the 13th century), and the [[Malay states]] began to emerge.

Indigenous written records from this period are virtually non-existent, as it seems that all Pacific Islanders, with the possible exception of the enigmatic [[Rapa Nui people|Rapa Nui]] and their currently undecipherable [[Rongorongo]] script, had no writing systems of any kind until after their introduction by European colonists; however, some indigenous prehistories can be estimated and academically reconstructed through careful, judicious analysis of native oral traditions, colonial ethnography, archaeology, physical anthropology and linguistics research.

==Modern history==
{{main article|Modern history}}
[[Modern history]] (the "modern period," the "modern era," "modern times") is history of the period following the Middle Ages. "[[Contemporary history]]" is history that only covers events from c. 1900 to the present day.

===Early modern period===

"[[Early modern period]]"<ref>"Early Modern," historically speaking, refers to [[Western Europe]]an history from 1501 (after the widely accepted end of the [[Late Middle Ages]]; the transition period was the 15th century) to either 1750 or c. 1790–1800, by which ever [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] is favored by a school of scholars defining the period—which, in many cases of [[periodization]], differs as well within a discipline such as art, philosophy or history.</ref> is a term used by historians to refer to the period between the [[Middle Ages]] ([[Post-classical history]]) and the [[Industrial Revolution]]&nbsp;– roughly 1500 to 1800. The Early Modern period is characterized by the rise of [[science]], and by increasingly rapid [[History of technology|technological progress]], [[Secularization|secular]]ized civic [[politics]], and the [[nation state]]. [[capitalist economy|Capitalist economies]] began their rise, initially in northern [[Italy|Italian]] [[republic]]s such as [[Genoa]]. The Early Modern period also saw the rise and dominance of the [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] economic theory. As such, the Early Modern period represents the decline and eventual disappearance, in much of the European sphere, of [[feudalism]], serfdom and the power of the [[Catholic Church]]. The period includes the [[Protestant Reformation]], the disastrous [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Age of Discovery]], European [[Colonialism|colonial expansion]], the peak of European [[witch-hunt]]ing, the [[Scientific revolution]],<ref name="Sedgwick1917">{{cite book|last1=Sedgwick|first1=W.

Historians also include the late 17th century, which is typically known as the Age of Reason or [[Age of Rationalism]], as part of the Enlightenment; however, contemporary historians have considered the Age of Reason distinct to the ideas developed in the Enlightenment.

====European expansion====

[[File:Gutenburg bible.jpg|thumb|[[movable type|Movable-type]] [[printing press]] arose in mid-15th century. 50 years later, nine million books were in print.]]
During this period, European powers came to dominate most of the world. Although the most developed regions of European classical civilization were more urbanized than any other region of the world, European civilization had undergone a lengthy period of gradual decline and collapse. During the Early Modern Period, Europe was able to regain its dominance; historians still debate the causes.

This success of Europe in this period stands in contrast to that of other regions. For example, one of the most advanced civilizations of the Middle Ages was China. It had developed an advanced [[monetary economy]] by 1,000 CE. China had a free [[peasant]]ry who were no longer subsistence farmers, and could sell their produce and actively participate in the market. According to [[Adam Smith]], writing in the 18th century, China had long been one of the richest, most fertile, best cultivated, most industrious, most urbanized, and most prosperous countries in the world.<ref name = "Adam">"[[The Wealth of Nations]]", [[Adam Smith]], 1776</ref> It enjoyed a technological advantage and had a monopoly in [[cast iron]] production, piston bellows, [[suspension bridge]] construction, [[printing]], and the [[compass]]. However, it seemed to have long since stopped progressing. Marco Polo, who visited China in the 13th century, describes its cultivation, industry, and populousness, almost in the same terms as travellers in the 18th century describe them.<ref name = "Adam"/>

One theory of Europe's rise holds that Europe's [[geography]] played an important role in its success. The [[Middle East]], [[India]] and [[China]] are all ringed by [[mountain]]s and [[ocean]]s but, once past these outer barriers, are nearly flat. By contrast, the [[Pyrenees]], [[Alps]], [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] and other mountain ranges run through Europe, and the continent is also divided by several [[sea]]s. This gave Europe some degree of protection from the peril of [[Central Asia]]n invaders. Before the era of firearms, these nomads were militarily superior to the agricultural states on the periphery of the [[Eurasia]]n continent and, as they broke out into the plains of northern India or the valleys of China, were all but unstoppable. These invasions were often devastating. The [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age of Islam]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kraemer|first1=Joel L.|title=Humanism in the renaissance of Islam: the cultural revival during the Buyid Age|date=1986|publisher=E.J. Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=90-04-07259-4|pages=1 & 148}}</ref> was ended by the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol]] [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|sack of Baghdad]] in 1258. India and China were subject to periodic [[invasion]]s, and [[Russia]] spent a couple of centuries under the [[Tatar invasions|Mongol-Tatar]] yoke. [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[western Europe]], logistically more distant from the [[Central Asia]]n heartland, proved less vulnerable to these threats.

Geography contributed to important [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] differences. For most of their histories, China, India, and the Middle East were each unified under a single dominant power that expanded until it reached the surrounding mountains and deserts. In 1600 the [[Ottoman Empire]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Imber|first1=Colin|title=The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1650: the structure of power|date=2002|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|isbn=0-333-61386-4}}</ref> controlled almost all the Middle East, the [[Ming dynasty]] ruled China,<ref name="ebrey 2006">{{Harvnb|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Ebrey|first1=Patricia Buckley|title=The Cambridge illustrated history of China|date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-66991-X}}</ref> and the [[Mughal Empire]] held sway over India. By contrast, Europe was almost always divided into a number of warring states. Pan-European empires, with the notable exception of the [[Roman Empire]], tended to collapse soon after they arose. Another doubtless important geographic factor in the rise of Europe was the [[Mediterranean Sea]], which, for millennia, had functioned as a maritime superhighway fostering the exchange of goods, people, ideas and inventions.

Nearly all the agricultural civilizations have been heavily constrained by their [[Natural environment|environments]]. Productivity remained low, and [[Climate|climatic]] changes easily instigated [[boom-and-bust]] [[Business cycle|cycles]] that brought about civilizations' rise and fall. By about 1500, however, there was a qualitative change in world history. [[Technology|Technological]] advance and the [[wealth]] generated by [[trade]] gradually brought about a widening of possibilities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant|first=A.

====Regional developments====
[[Persia]] came under the rule of the [[Safavid Empire]] in 1501, succeeded by the [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid Empire]] in 1736, and the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Empire]] in 1796. Areas to the north and east were held by [[Uzbeks]] and [[Pashtuns]]. The [[Ottoman Empire]], after taking [[Constantinople]] in 1453, quickly gained control of the [[Middle East]], the [[Balkans]], and most of [[North Africa]].

In [[History of Africa|Africa]], this period saw a decline in many civilizations and an advancement in others. The [[History of Africa#Swahili Coast|Swahili Coast]] declined after coming under Portuguese (and later [[History of Oman|Omani]]) control. In west Africa, the [[Songhai Empire]] fell to the Moroccans in 1591 when they invaded with guns. The South African [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]] gave way to smaller kingdoms such as [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mutapa]], [[Kingdom of Butua|Butua]], and [[Rozwi Empire|Rozwi]]. [[Ethiopia]] suffered from the 1531 invasion from neighbouring Muslim [[Adal Sultanate]], and in 1769 entered the [[Zemene Mesafint]] (Age of Princes) during which the Emperor became a figurehead and the country was ruled by warlords, though the royal line later would recover under Emperor [[Tewodros II]]. The [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]], in the [[Horn of Africa]], began to decline in the 17th century, succeeded by the [[Sultanate of the Geledi|Geledi Sultanate]]. Other civilizations in Africa advanced during this period. The [[Oyo Empire]] experienced its golden age, as did the [[Benin Empire]]. The [[Ashanti Empire]] rose to power in what is modern day [[Ghana]] in 1670. The [[Kingdom of Kongo]] also thrived during this period. European [[exploration of Africa]] reached its zenith at this time.

In the Far East, the [[History of China|Chinese]] [[Ming Dynasty]] gave way (1644) to the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], the last Chinese imperial dynasty, which would rule until 1912. [[History of Japan|Japan]] experienced its [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] (1568 – 1603), followed by the [[Edo period]] (1603-1868). The [[History of Korea|Korean]] [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392-1910) ruled throughout this period, successfully repelling 16th- and 17th-century invasions from Japan and China. Japan and China were significantly affected during this period by expanded maritime trade with Europe, particularly the Portuguese in Japan. During the Edo period, Japan would pursue isolationist policies, to eliminate foreign influences.

On the [[Indian subcontinent]], the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and the [[Deccan sultanates]] would give way, beginning in the 16th century, to the [[Mughal Empire]]. Starting in the northwest, the Mughal Empire would by the late 17th century come to rule the entire subcontinent,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lal|first1=Vinay|url=https://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/History/Mughals/mughals.html|title=The Mughal Empire|work=Manas: India and its Neighbors|publisher=University of California, Los Angeles|date=2001|accessdate=12 April 2015}}</ref> except for the southernmost Indian provinces, which would remain independent. Against the Muslim Mughal Empire, the Hindu [[Maratha Empire]] was founded on the west coast in 1674, gradually gaining territory – a majority of present-day India—from the Mughals over several decades, particularly in the [[Mughal–Maratha Wars]] (1681-1701). The Maratha Empire would fall to the British in 1818, under the control of the British [[East India Company]], with all former Maratha and Mughal authority devolving to the [[British Raj]] in 1858.

In 1511, the Portuguese overthrew the [[Malacca Sultanate]] in present-day [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]n [[Sumatra]]. The Portuguese held this important trading territory (and the valuable associated navigational strait) until overthrown by the Dutch in 1641. The [[Johor Sultanate]], centred on the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, became the dominant trading power in the region. [[Western imperialism in Asia|European colonization]] would affect the whole of Southeast Asia – the British in [[History of Myanmar|Myanmar]] and [[History of Malaysia|Malaysia]], the French in [[Indochina]], the Dutch in the [[Dutch East Indies|Netherlands East Indies]], and the Spanish in the [[History of the Philippines|Philippines]]. Only [[History of Thailand|Thailand]] would successfully resist colonization.

The Pacific islands of [[History of Oceania|Oceania]] would also be affected by European contact, starting with the circumnavigational voyage of [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who landed on the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] and other islands in 1521. Also notable were the voyages (1642–44) of [[Abel Tasman]] to present-day [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and nearby islands, and the voyages (1768-1779) of Captain [[James Cook]], who made the first recorded European contact with [[History of Hawaii|Hawaii]]. Britain would found its first colony on Australia in 1788.

In the [[History of the Americas|Americas]], the [[European colonization of the Americas|western European powers]] vigorously colonized the newly discovered continents, largely displacing the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous populations]], and destroying the advanced civilizations of the [[Aztec]]s and the [[Inca]]. Spain, Portugal, Britain, and France all made extensive territorial claims, and undertook large-scale settlement, including the importation of large numbers of African [[Slavery in the Americas|slaves]]. Portugal claimed [[History of Brazil|Brazil]]. Spain claimed the rest of [[History of South America|South America]], [[Mesoamerica]], and southern [[History of North America|North America]]. Britain colonized the east coast of North America, and France colonized the central region of North America. Russia made incursions onto the northwest coast of North America, with a first colony in present-day [[History of Alaska|Alaska]] in 1784,<ref name="Black2004,p.102">{{harvnb|Black|2004|p=102}}</ref> and the outpost of [[Fort Ross, California|Fort Ross]] in present-day [[History of California|California]] in 1812.<ref name="Black2004,p.181">{{harvnb|Black|2004|p=181}}</ref> In 1762, in the midst of the [[Seven Years' War]], France secretly ceded most of its North American claims to Spain in the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]]. Thirteen of the British colonies declared independence as the [[History of the United States|United States of America]] in 1776, ratified by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, ending the [[American Revolutionary War]]. [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] won France’s claims back from Spain in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1800, but sold them to the United States in 1803 as the [[Louisiana Purchase]].

In [[History of Russia|Russia]], [[Ivan the Terrible]] was crowned (1547) the first [[Tsar]] of Russia, and by annexing the Turkic Khanates in the east, transformed Russia into a regional power. The countries of western Europe, while expanding prodigiously through technological advancement and colonial conquest, competed with each other economically and militarily in a state of almost constant [[List of wars 1500–1799|war]]. Often the wars had a [[European wars of religion|religious dimension]], either Catholic versus Protestant, or (primarily in eastern Europe) Christian versus Muslim. Wars of particular note include the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the [[Seven Years' War]], and the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. Napoleon came to power in France in 1799, an event foreshadowing the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century.

As the developed world shifted from a [[coal]]-based to a [[petroleum]]-based economy, new transport technologies, along with the dawn of the [[Information Age]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lallana |first1=Emmanuel C. |first2=Margaret N. |last2=Uy |title=[[b:The Information Age|The Information Age]]|publisher=UNDP-APDIP|date=2003}}</ref> led to increased [[globalization]].<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=von Braun |editor-first1=Joachim |editor-first2=Eugenio|editor-last2=Diaz-Bonilla |title=Globalization of Food and Agriculture and the Poor |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2007 |url=https://www.ifpri.org/publication/globalization-food-and-agriculture-and-poor |isbn=978-0-19-569528-1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Friedman | first = Thomas L. | authorlink = Thomas Friedman | title = [[The World Is Flat]] | publisher = Farrar, Straus and Giroux | date = 2005 | location = New York | isbn = 0-374-29288-4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Murray | first = Warwick E. | title = Geographies of Globalization | publisher = Routledge/Taylor and Francis | date = 2006 | location = New York | isbn = 0-415-31799-1 }}</ref> [[Space exploration]] reached throughout the [[Solar System]].

{{Main article|21st century}}
A man-made hazard to world survival that dominated concerns in the second half of the 20th century, continues into the 21st.  Countries ambitious to develop and deploy [[nuclear weapons]] are discouraged from doing so by countries that already possess them.  At the same time, nuclear-armed countries have shown little urgency about honoring their 20th-century pledge to eventually eliminate all nuclear weapons.  Such weapons continue to be equally hazardous to their owners as to their potential targets.<ref>[[Eric Schlosser]], ''[[Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety]]'', [[Penguin Press]], 2013, ISBN 1594202273.</ref> 

The 21st century has been marked by growing [[economic globalization]] and integration, with consequent increased risk to interlinked economies, and by the expansion of communications with [[mobile phone]]s and the [[Internet]].  The rise of the [[personal computer]] and the the [[Worldwide Web]] has caused fundamental changes in multiple aspects of human society, in both business and personal spheres.

The early 21st century saw escalating intra- and international strife in the [[Middle East]] and [[Afghanistan]], stimulated by vast economic disparities, by dissatisfaction with governments dominated by Western interests, by inter-ethnic and inter-sectarian feuds, and by the longest war in the history of the [[United States]], the proximate cause for which was [[Osama bin Laden]]'s provocative 2001 destruction of [[New York City]]'s [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].  

U.S. military involvements in the Middle East and Afghanistan drained U.S. economic resources at a time when the U.S. and other Western countries were experiencing mounting socioeconomic dislocations aggravated by the [[robotization]] of work and the exportation of industries to cheaper-workforce countries.
 
Worldwide [[demand]] and [[competition]] for [[Natural resource|resources]] has risen due to growing populations and industrialization, especially in India, China and [[Brazil]] (see [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions per capita]]). This increased demand is causing increased levels of environmental degradation and a growing threat of [[global warming]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Energy and power: a Scientific American book|date=1971|publisher=W H Freeman|location=San Francisco|isbn=9780716709398|pages=vii–viii|chapter=Foreword}}</ref> That, and a need for reliable energy supplies independent of politically volatile regions, has spurred the development of alternate, [[renewable energy|renewable]] sources of [[energy]] (notably [[solar energy]] and [[Wind power|wind energy]]), proposals for cleaner [[fossil fuel|fossil-fuel]] technologies<ref>Critiqued in {{cite journal |first=David |last=Biello |title=The Carbon Capture Fallacy |journal=Scientific American |volume=314 |issue=1 |date=January 2016 |pages=58–65|pmid=26887197 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0116-58}}.</ref> and for expanded use of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] (somewhat dampened by [[Nuclear accidents#Nuclear power plant accidents|nuclear-plant accidents]]),<ref>{{cite book |first=M.
