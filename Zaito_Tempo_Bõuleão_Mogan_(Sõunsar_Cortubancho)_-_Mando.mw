Modench pavun nadlim dusmanan.

Halfway we were cheated by an enemy.

Atam bõutam rê fugar zaun,

Dusman bõutat mun amchê patlean.

Our enemies are following us.



Chusmo/ Refrain:

Môg ãvem côrun tujo dusman zalo ré ubo,

After falling in love with you my enemy got active (lit. stood up),

Sõvnsar foroch cortubancho.

This world is indeed full of troubles.



Rod'tam rod'tam rogtachim ducam.

I am weeping and weeping tears of blood.

Dusmananc moga borem magtam.

I am wishing the enemy well, my dear.

Sõvnsarachi axea maca nam,

I have no desire to live in this world,

Bogor sorguincho rosto tanctam. (Chusmo)

I am just walking the road to heaven. (Refrain)

Tujea rupcaralaguim keutam,

Vonttanc-vontt tencoun beiju diunc vetam,

I try to bring my lips near to yours and kiss you,

Zaguim zaun moga fotoutam. (Chusmo)

Waking up I feel deceived. (Refrain)



'''The Mando'''

''The mando is a dance song from [[गोंय|Goa]] in Konkani. Although it is popular among all the social stratas of the Konkani-speaking peoples and many of the composers have remained anonymous, it should not be classified as a folk song. It is an art song composed for particular occasions. There have been many attempts to explain the origin of the word mando. One of them refers to the mand which was traditionally an open space of about 100 sq.m. where religious ceremonies were held and folk dances were performed. The text form of the mando is based on that of the traditional Konkani song ovi, which was usually sung at weddings''

''Most of the the traditional mandos, which gained the term “classical”, were composed in the 19th century. The polka and the valsavina (Vienna Waltz) with its three-four rhythm seem to have found their way to [[गोंय|Goa]]. The mando was originally composed and danced by the Brahmin aristocracy of [[गोंय|Goa]], mainly of Salcete, whose spacious mansions had a big hall for festive occasions. A memorable moment in the history of the family was the 
bridal mando. The mando reflects the tranquil and leisurely character of this aristocracy. The [[गोंय|Goa]]n woman in the mando reflects the ideals and virtues then ascribed to her, namely self-sacrifice, piety and motherhood.'' 

''As a dance the mando is a square type (double file), men facing the women. When the partners come face to face in the centre, they retreat to the starting point, then move forward again crossing to the opposite side. The men then flick their handkerchiefs while the women open their fans. All in all, it is a stately and leisurely dance. The melody of the mando is slow in movement, with a soft and languishing atmosphere.''
