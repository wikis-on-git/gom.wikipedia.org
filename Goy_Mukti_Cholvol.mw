The '''Goa liberation movement''' was a movement which sought to end  [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonial]] rule in [[Goa]], India. The movement built on the small scale revolts and [[Rebellion|uprisings]] of the 19th century, and grew powerful during the period 1940-1961. The movement was conducted both inside and outside Goa, and was characterised by a range of tactics including [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] demonstrations, [[revolution]]ary methods and [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] efforts.<ref name="mapsoi">{{cite web|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/goa/geography-and-history/liberation-of-goa.html|title=Liberation of Goa|accessdate=2009-06-01|quote=The struggle for Goa’s liberty was two fold – from within Goa and from the outside Goa – which was conducted by the Indian Government.}}</ref><ref name="goa2udotcom">{{cite web|url=http://www.goa2u.com/history.htm|title=History Of Goa – Goa's Past|accessdate=2009-06-01|quote=The success of the post independence Goans struggle for freedom from Portugal owed as much to the efforts of the Indian Government who cut off diplomatic ties with Portugal as to the work of freedom fighters ...}}</ref> However, Portuguese control of its [[India]]n colonies ended only when India [[Invasion of Goa|invaded Goa]] in 1961<ref name="gpp">{{cite web|url=http://gpp.nic.in/Liberation.html|title=Liberation of Goa|accessdate=2009-06-01}}</ref> and incorporated the territories into the [[India|Indian Union]].

==Portuguese possessions in India==
{{Main article|Portuguese India}}
The Portuguese colonised India in 1510, conquering many parts of the western coast and establishing several colonies in the east. By the end of the 19th century, Portuguese colonies in India were limited to [[Goa]], [[Daman, Daman and Diu|Daman]], [[Diu, India|Diu]], [[Dadra]], [[Nagar Haveli]] and [[Anjediva Island]].

==Revolts against Portuguese rule==
Many Goans living under [[Colonialism|colonial rule]] resented  Portuguese rule due to policies perceived as brutal as well as [[Mandate (politics)|mandates]] and relentless government campaigns to convert the predominantly [[Hindu]] Goans to [[Christianity]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Amelia Thomas|title=Goa and Mumbai|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZxY69WvM5o0C|year=2009|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-894-0|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZxY69WvM5o0C&pg=PA45 45]}}</ref> Despite 14 revolts against Portuguese rule (the final attempt in 1912),<ref name="Lonely_Planet_Goa">{{cite book|last=Harding|first=Paul|title=Lonely Planet|publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2003|pages=224|isbn=1-74059-139-9 |id=ISBN 9781740591393}}</ref> none of these uprisings were successful in ending the colonial era. The failure of these uprisings to affect meaningful change was attributed to the lack of a broad, active support base and their localised nature.

==The independence movement==

===Early 20th century===
The [[Abolished monarchy|abolition]] of the [[Portuguese monarchy]] in 1910 raised hopes that the colonies would be granted [[self-determination]]; however, when Portuguese colonial policies remained unchanged, an organised and dedicated anti-colonial movement emerged.<ref name="Lonely_Planet_Goa"/> [[Luís de Menezes Bragança]] founded ''[[O Heraldo]]'', the first Portuguese language newspaper in Goa, which was critical of Portuguese colonial rule.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} In 1917, the ''"Carta Organica"'' law was passed, overseeing all [[civil liberties]] in Goa.

In reaction to growing [[dissent]], the Portuguese government in Goa implemented polices which curtailed civil liberties, including [[censorship]] of the [[News media|press]]. Strict censorship policies required any material containing printed words, including invitation cards, to be submitted to a censorship committee for screening. The Portuguese governor of Goa was empowered to suspend publication, close down [[printing press]]es and impose heavy fines on [[newspaper]]s which refused to comply with these policies. Many Goans criticised the curtailing of press freedoms, stating that the only newspapers and [[Periodical literature|periodicals]] the Portuguese permitted them to publish were pro-colonialist [[propaganda]] materials.<ref name="Perera">Janaka Perera, Goa's Liberation and Sri Lanka's Crisis, Asian Tribune, 18 December 2006 [http://www.asiantribune.com/node/3709]</ref>

Menezes Bragança organised a rally in [[Margao]] denouncing the law and, for some time, the [[Goans]] received the same rights as mainland [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]].<ref name="Sakhsena">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7kUE7TV3ZWEC&printsec=frontcover |title=Goa: Into the Mainstream |isbn=81-7017-005-2 |id=ISBN 978-81-7017005-1 |date=1 June 2003 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |accessdate=1 April 2014 |first=R.N. |last=Sakshena}}</ref> However, the [[Roman Catholicism in Portugal|Portuguese Catholic Church]] strongly supported pro-colonial polices and attempted to influence Goan [[Christian]]s to oppose the independence movement. The Portuguese [[Patriarch]] of the Catholic Church in Goa issued over 60 official letters to the priests of the [[Diocese|archdiocese]], instructing them to preach to their congregations that [[salvation]] lay with the Portuguese and in dissociating themselves from cultural-political relationship with the rest of India.<ref>Teotonio R. de Souza, "The Church in Goa: Giving to Caesar What is Caesar's?" para 5 [http://www.goacom.com/culture/history/church.html]</ref>

===1920–1940===
In 1928, [[Tristão de Bragança Cunha]] founded the Goa National Congress. At the [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] session of the [[Indian National Congress]], the Goa Congress Committee received recognition and representation in the [[All-India Congress Committee]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In May 1930, Portugal passed the ''"[[Acto Colonial]]"'' (Colonial Act), which restricted political rallies and meetings within all Portuguese colonies. The introduction of this act politically relegated Goa to the status of a [[colony]]. The Portuguese also introduced a policy of compulsory [[conscription]] in [[Portuguese India]], which contributed significantly to growing resentment against the colonial government.<ref name="Sakhsena"/>

The Portuguese government pressured the Indian National Congress to disaffiliate the National Congress (Goa); however, in 1938, Goans in [[Bombay|Bombay city]] formed the Provisional Goa Congress.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===1940s===
By the 1940s, the Goan independence movement had gained momentum, inspired by the [[Indian independence movement]], which had entered its crucial phase, as well as the 1946 British announcement to grant India independence, after which Indian leaders focused their attention on the movements in [[Portuguese India]] and [[French India]] that sought to join the newly independent Indian state.

When Bragança Cunha was arrested in 1946, A.G. Tendulkar became the president of the Goa Congress and organised a meeting in [[Londa, Karnataka|Londa]] (outside Goa).{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} 
[[Dr Julião Menezes]] studied in Goa and after finishing Lyceum, (Portuguese high school) he attended Berlin University in the 1920s and graduated in medicine – MD. He also took courses in Indology in Berlin. It was there that he met [[Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia]], who was studying at the same University.<ref name="colaco.net">http://www.colaco.net/1/leitaoDrJuliao.htm</ref> 
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia and Dr Julião Menezes remained in contact and Dr. Menezes even provided him shelter after the ‘Do or Die’ call given by Mahatma Gandhi. It is believed that Dr. Lohia wanted to hide in Goa but decided against it following counselling by Dr. Menezes who was worried that British agents were active in Goa as well. The two met again in 1946 after Dr. Lohia’s release from prison in Lahore where he was taken after his arrest in Mumbai. Dr. Lohia had visited Dr. Menezes for a medical examination in Bombay where the latter advised the former that he rest and invited him to his house in Assolna, Goa.,<ref name="colaco.net"/><ref name="heraldgoa.in">http://www.heraldgoa.in/Goa/The-forgotten-history-of-18th-June/89901.html</ref>
Accepting the invitation, Dr. Lohia arrived in Goa on 10 June 1946 and stayed at the residence of Menezes at Assolna, where the two stalwarts discussed the situation prevailing in Goa during that period and decided to defy the ban on public meetings imposed by the Portuguese Government. This was the first civil disobedience movement against the then 435-year-old Portuguese rule. The news of Lohia’s arrival spread among Goans and Dr. Menezes’ place in Assolna became the meeting place for Goan intellectuals and political activists, who wanted to consult Dr. Lohia and Dr. Menezes.<ref name="heraldgoa.in"/>
On 15 June 1946, Dr. Menezes and Dr. Lohia addressed a gathering of the people in Panjim but the police did not intervene and stop the meeting even as they were posted at the place where the meeting took place.  Buoyed with the success of the meeting, the two entered Margao square in a horse carriage.<ref name="heraldgoa.in"/>  
On 18 June with thousands of men and women welcoming them and chanting their names "Dr Lohia-ki Jai! Dr Julião Menezes-ki-Jai!". Dr. Lohia's and Dr. Menezes were arrested.   The colonial administration, which was caught off guard, failed to subdue the fervor of the crowd. Julião and Lohia were arrested and removed at the dead of night to the Panjim police station.  
The news of their arrest spread throughout Goa, and the people demonstrated in most of the towns. In Margão, next morning, the citizens drove in procession, and in the evening, they gathered in front of the Câmara. Even though the troops sought to disperse the crowd, they squatted resolutely on the ground, shouting in unison at the top of their voices, which resounded throughout the town: Jai Hind!!  Dr. Lohiako shodd do! Dr. Julião Menezesko shodd do!

In the end that day, Dr Julião Menezes was released and Dr Lohia was driven outside of Goa and released. Their arrest at this demonstration motivated people to hold large-scale [[protest]]s in support of the independence movement, which resulted in large-scale arrests and the incarceration of over 1,500 people.<ref name="Lonely_Planet_Goa"/> Goan leaders, including Bragança Cunha, [[Purushottam Kakodkar]] and Laxmikant Bhembre were deported to [[Portugal]] for their participation in the independence protests.<ref name="Sakhsena"/>

The Government of Goa, Daman and Diu failed to recognize Dr. Julião’s contribution to the cause when he was alive. Though he was honored on 18 June 1986 after his death, he deserves to be remembered in a monumental way.<ref name="colaco.net"/>

From October to November 1946, a series of [[satyagraha]]s (non-violent civil-disobedience actions) were held in Goa; however, many of the leaders of these actions were arrested. With the arrest of the leadership, much of the momentum of the movement was lost and, subsequently, the Goa Congress began to operate from Bombay.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

During the mid-1940s, a number of new political parties emerged in Goa, each having a conflicting agenda and perspective in relation to achieving Goan independence and [[autonomy]]. These political parties advocated for vastly different policies including Goa's merger with [[Maharashtra]] state, Goa's merger with the southern Indian state of [[Karnataka]], independent statehood for Goa and autonomy within Portuguese rule.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] sensed that an independence movement with such disparate perspectives would be ineffective and could undermine the struggle for independence; hence, Gandhi suggested that the various independence [[Political faction|factions]] should attempt to unite under the broad guise of civil liberties. In response to Gandhi's suggestion, the different Goan political factions met in Bombay in June 1947 to formally launch a campaign demanding that the Portuguese government "quit India". The Goan leadership believed that with the end of British colonial occupation, an end to Portuguese colonial occupation would logically follow. However, on 3 August 1947, Lohia{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} announced that Goa's independence  would not coincide with Indian national independence and that the Goans would have to continue their struggle, "not just for civil liberties, but for freedom itself".{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The failure of Goa to achieve independence within the national independence struggle, in conjunction with mixed signals from the new national Indian leadership in [[New Delhi]] and harsh repression by the Portuguese, led to  a temporary lull in the Goan independence movement. Similarly, the [[partition of India]] and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]] diverted the focus of the national Indian leadership from the anti-colonial struggles in the Portuguese and [[List of French possessions and colonies|French colonies]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Following national Indian independence, a separate demand for independence was raised by [[Froilano de Mello|Dr. Froilano de Mello]], a prominent Goan [[microbiologist]] and [[Member of Parliament#Portugal|MP]] in the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Portuguese National Assembly]]. De Mello sought independence for Goa, Daman and Diu as autonomous state entities within the framework of a Portuguese [[commonwealth]], similar to the [[British Commonwealth]].<ref>[http://www.goacom.com/culture/biographies/froil1.html Professor Froilano de Mello, MD (1887–1955): A short biography of his life and achievements] {{webarchive |url=http://www.webcitation.org/64AJJAqCX?url=http://www.goacom.com/culture/biographies/froil1.html |date=24 December 2011 }} – Goacom.com</ref>

===Demand for autonomy===
Within Goa and Portugal, periodic demands for autonomy for Portuguese India continued. In July 1946, a public meeting was held which openly petitioned the [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] administration to grant autonomy to the [[Estado da India]]. The meeting was facilitated by José Inácio de Loyola, and inspired the formation of a committee chaired by [[Uday Bhembre]] to pursue autonomy. Bhembre's committee failed to provoke a response from the Portuguese administration, and subsequently the last demand for autonomy was made by Purushottam Kakodkar in early 1961.<ref name="Blood_Nemesis_review">{{cite web|url=http://goabooks2.blogspot.com/2005/12/blood-nemesis-and-misreading-quite.html|title=BLOOD, NEMESIS AND MISREADING QUITE WHAT MAKES GOAN SOCIETY TICK by Ben Antao, review by Lino Leitao|last=Leitao|first=Lino|date=23 December 2005|accessdate=2009-05-23}}</ref>

===Diplomatic efforts===
In December 1947, independent India and [[Portugal]] established diplomatic ties. In January 1948, Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] met the Portuguese [[Consul (representative)|consul]] and raised the issue of Goa's integration into the Indian Union. The Portuguese, who valued their strategic Indian colonial outposts, were unwilling to negotiate and by 1948, the Goan anti-colonial movement had virtually disbanded.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In January 1953, the Indian [[delegation]] in Portugal (a representative body of the Indian government), sought to negotiate with Portugal on the issue of its territories in India. The Indian government offered a direct transfer; however, the Portuguese refused and diplomatic relations between the two countries deteriorated. On 11 June 1953, the Indian delegation in [[Lisbon]] was closed{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} and diplomatic ties were formally severed. In July 1953, Nehru stated that the Indian government's position involved French and Portuguese colonies in India integrating into the Indian Union.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Despite Nehru clearly stating India's policy in relation to colonial outposts, Portugal and [[France]] refused to [[Cession|cede]] their colonies. Subsequently, India launched a campaign through the [[United Nations|UN]] in an attempt to persuade the Portuguese to leave India peacefully.<ref name="Lonely_Planet_Goa"/>

===Revolutionary groups===
Azad Gomantak Dal, a revolutionary group, vowed to fight the Portuguese using [[direct action]] strategies. Azad Gomantak Dal was founded by  Vishwanath Lawande, Narayan Hari Naik, Dattatraya Deshpande, Prabhakar Sinari who along with  their other  friends carried out series of attacks  on  Portuguese police stations and banks .  all of them  were sentenced to  28–29 years of imprisonment in exile by the Portuguese courts. Narayan Naik and Dattatraya Deshpande suffered about 14 years of imprisonment in prisons in Portugal  and Angola, however they were released after annexation of Goa. Vishwanath Lawande and  Prabhakar Sinari managed to escape the prisons and continued their  armed struggle against the Portuguese rule by forming huge  armed force of  anti-colonial fighters with headquarter on Goa India border at Vazarem .  Azad Gomantak Dal successfully carried out [[Raid (military)|raids]] on police stations and factories, ambushed [[Patrol#Military|military patrols]], attacked troops stationed at the border and blew up [[ammunition dump]]s. they freed  part of Goa  called "Dadara and Nagarhaveli" vide military action. the leader of the military organisation  Vishwanath Lawande  declared himself  as Governor of  Dadra and Nagarhaveli. However, in response to the group's revolutionary tactics, the Portuguese increased their military presence by bringing in [[White race|white]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique|African]] troops to quell the [[insurgency]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The Goa Liberation Army, founded by Shivajirao Desai, an Indian army officer in the 1950s, attempted to utilise revolutionary tactics and direct action strategies to challenge Portuguese colonialism.  It blasted [[Sesa Goa|Sesa Goa's]] Sonshi mine, which caused temporary suspension of the mining activity of the Portuguese.  The Goa Liberation Army was credited with many other blasts and raids, and played a pivotal role in defending the bridges at the time of Indian invasion.<ref name="Lonely_Planet_Goa"/>

===1953 onwards: intensification of Satyagraha movement===
In 1953, [[Tristão de Bragança Cunha]] formed the Goa Action Committee to coordinate the various anti-colonial groups working independently in [[Mumbai]]. [[Goans]] and non-Goans offered [[Satyagraha]] in [[solidarity]] with the struggle.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In Goa, the anti-colonial movement had evolved into two camps, which advocated distinct anti-colonial strategies.  The National Congress Goa utilised peaceful [[satyagraha]] tactics, while Azad Gomantak Dal advocated revolutionary methods. On 15 August 1954, a mass satyagraha was instigated; however, despite the use of non-violent [[civil disobedience]] protest strategies, the Portuguese authorities assaulted and arrested many participants.<ref name="Lonely_Planet_Goa"/> [[P.D. Gaitonde]] was arrested for publicly protesting Portuguese colonialist policy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

A year later, another protest was organised on the same date. The [[Jana Sangh]] leader, Karnataka Kesari [[Jagannathrao Joshi]], led 3,000 protesters including women, children and Indians from [[Maharashtra]] state, through the Goa border. The security forces [[Baton charge|baton]] charged the protesters and opened fire on the satyagraha, resulting in several deaths and hundreds of injuries.<ref name="Lonely_Planet_Goa"/>

As Portugal was now a member of [[NATO]], the Indian government was reticent to react to the situation. NATO [[Member states of the United Nations|member nations]] had a pact to protect each other in the event that any member state came under attack from an external force. Although the NATO treaty did not cover colonies, Portugal insisted that its overseas interests were not colonies but an integral part of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Nation of Portugal]]. Hence, in order for India to avoid NATO involvement in Goa, the Indian government was impeded from speaking out against Portugal's response to satyagraha protest actions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In 1954, the Goa Vimochan Sahayak Samiti (All-Party Goa Liberation Committee), was formed with the aim of continuing the civil disobedience campaign and providing financial and political assistance to the satyagrahis. The Maharashtra and [[Gujarat]] chapters of the [[Praja Socialist Party]] assisted the liberation committee, motivated by an agenda for independent Goa to merge into Maharashtra state. The liberation committee and the [[Praja Socialist Party]] collaboratively organised several satyagrahas in 1954–55.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The Portuguese government appealed to various international [[Power (international relations)|powers]], charging India with violation of Portugal's territorial [[sovereignty]] due to the actions of the Satyagrahas in crossing Portuguese Goan borders. Nehru was subsequently pressured to announce that India formally disapproved of the Satyagrahas.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Nehru's denouncement of the Satyagraha severely impacted on the independence movement. Following Nehru's professed lack of support for the satyagrahi, a satyagrahi plan to cross the Goan border at [[Fort Tiracol|Terekhol Fort]] attracted very few supporters. Despite the low turnout, a small group managed to cross the Goan border to successfully occupy the Terekhol fort overnight.

With the exception of a small number of satyagrahas and the activities of the All-Goa Political Party Committee, 
lacking the support of the national Indian government, the anti-colonial movement lost its momentum.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Pro-independence advocacy actions were sporadic and few were willing to involve themselves in the movement. On 18 June 1954, Satyagrahis infiltrated Goa and hoisted the Indian flag; however, the demonstrators and suspected sympathisers were arrested, and anti-colonialist [[Activism|activists]] Dr. Gaitonde and Shriyut Deshpande were [[Deportation|deported]] to Portugal.<ref name="Sakhsena"/>

===Annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli===
{{Main article|Indian annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli}}

On 21 July 1954, the [[United front|United Front]] of Goans (led by Francis Mascarenhas) forced the Portuguese to retreat from the colonial [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]] of [[Dadra]], a small [[Landlocked country|landlocked territory]] bordering [[Nagar Haveli]]. A group of volunteers from the National Movement Liberation Organisation (NMLO), an umbrella organisation involving revolutionary groups [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] and Azad Gomantak Dal, led an attack on [[Nagar Haveli]] on 28 July 1954, and took it on 2 August.<ref name =lele>P S Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, Published by Usha P. Lele, 1987,</ref> Despite successfully conquering the territories, India did not immediately assimilate these enclaves into the Indian Union. For some time, both enclaves functioned as [[de facto]] independent states, administered by the Varishta Panchayat of Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

The successful annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli provided the dormant Goa anti-colonial movement with renewed vigour and motivation to continue the anti-colonial struggle.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} On 15 August 1954, hundreds of people crossed the Portuguese Goan borders, defying a ban by the Indian government on participating in Satyagrahas. The Portuguese responded to the action by injuring and fatally shooting many Satyagrahis.<ref name="Sakhsena"/>

The Portuguese responded to the Satyagrahas, which continued throughout 1955, by sealing Goa's borders in an attempt to curb the growing support for the movement. By 1955, the Indian government had developed a clear policy on Portuguese Goan territory, which supported the anti-colonial movement. Between 1955 and 1961, six political parties were formed to advocate for an end to Portuguese colonial rule. These parties included Azad Gomantak Dal, Rancour Patriota, the United Front of Goans, Goan People's Party, Goa Liberation Army and Quit Goa Organisation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Many Goans reportedly felt that the Portuguese were deliberately misleading the international community by portraying Goans as [[Luso-Indian]] or Portuguese. Following his release from prison, P.D. Gaitonde conducted a series of international lectures to challenge this notion. With increased support from the international community and rebellions in the [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|Portuguese African colonies]], the policy position of the India government was able to become more [[hardline]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In 1961, India proclaimed that Goa should join India "either with full peace or with full use of force". In August 1961, India began military preparations and, following Nehru's announcement on 1 December 1961, that India would not remain silent in relation to the Goan situation, Indian troops were strategically stationed close to the Goan border.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Annexation of Goa==
After failure of diplomacy with the Portuguese, Nehru ordered the [[Indian Armed Forces]] to take Goa by force. In a [[Invasion of Goa|military operation]] conducted on 18 and 19 December 1961, Indian troops captured Goa with little resistance. The [[List of governors of Portuguese India|governor-general]] of Portuguese India signed an instrument of surrender.<ref name="Lonely_Planet_Goa"/>

==Subsequent events==
Major General [[Kunhiraman Palat Candeth]] was appointed military [[governor]] of Goa.that was first created by British government in 1934. In 1963, the [[Parliament of India]] passed the 12th Amendment Act to the [[Constitution of India]], formally integrating the captured territories into the Indian Union.<ref name="Lonely_Planet_Goa"/> [[Goa, Daman and Diu]] became a [[Union Territory]]. [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]],which was previously a part of the [[Estado da India]], but independent between 1954 and 1961, became a separate Union Territory.

In October 1962, [[Panchayati Raj|Panchayat elections]] were held in Goa, followed by assembly elections in December 1962. On 16 January 1967, a [[Goa Opinion Poll|referendum]] was held in which the people of Goa voted against merger with Maharashtra. Portugal recognised Goa's accession into the Indian union only in 1974. In 1987, [[Goa]] was separated from [[Daman and Diu]] and made a full-fledged state. [[Daman and Diu]] continued as a new Union Territory.<ref name="Lonely_Planet_Goa"/>

Due to an unabated influx of people from all over India to Goa, the native Goan people have begun to fear for their identity and culture. There are growing calls for the government of India to grant [[Goa Special Status]] so that the local government can regulate in-[[Human migration|migration]] and stop the sale of land to non-Goans.

==Films==
''[[Saat Hindustani]]'' ([[translation]]: ''Seven Indians'') is a 1969 film written and directed by [[Khwaja Ahmad Abbas]]. The film portrays the story of seven Indians who attempt to liberate Goa from Portuguese colonial rule.
